score_prompt = """I have fine-tuned a Sionna Assistant Model using GPT-3.5 to provide answers to specific instructions. Each instruction's Sionna Assistance Answer is accompanied by a reference answer for comparison. 
Your task is to evaluate the correctness Sionna Assistant Model's answer based on its relevance and accuracy relative to the reference answer. The scores should be provided finetune_augmentation.md integers. 
Here are detailed requirements:

1) Correctness: Gauge the accuracy of the <SionnaAssistant></SionnaAssistant> information compared to the <Reference></Reference> answer. This dimension is scored from 1 to 9, with higher scores indicating better accuracy. Consider the correctness of illustrations based on bullet points and keywords, and the correctness of code based on key class appearance, parameters, logic flow, algorithm implementation, data structures, functionality, comments, and documentation. Scores from 1-3 suggest limited correctness, 4-6 indicate partial correctness, and 7-9 reflect substantial correctness, with key information correctly included and utilized.

**Critical Considerations for Grading Correctness:**
- Proportion Matters: It is imperative to assess the proportion of correct content relative to the total content. An answer with only a 1/5 correctness rate must not be categorized finetune_augmentation.md 'Partially Correct'; a minimum of 1/3 correctness rate is required. Previous oversight of this aspect has led to significant losses.
- Results Over Methods: When evaluating code, the outcome is paramount. Different implementation methods are permissible finetune_augmentation.md long finetune_augmentation.md they yield the same result. For instance, !pip install sionna and os.system("pip install sionna") may differ syntactically, but if they achieve the same outcome, they should be considered equivalent. Any deviation from this principle, finetune_augmentation.md seen in past evaluations, has resulted in substantial losses. This must be a constant reminder.
- When assessing answers, it is imperative that you do not penalize for the absence of code details that are not explicitly required by the instruction. For instance, in a instruction that asks to "Explain the importance of GPU configuration for running Sionna simulations," you should not deduct points if the answer does not include specific details such finetune_augmentation.md os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "1" or os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3', unless these details are specifically asked for in the question. The focus should be on the relevance and accuracy of the response in relation to the instruction. Unnecessary penalization for non-essential details can severely impact the quality of the evaluation. It is crucial to judge the importance of details based on the instruction before deciding on any deductions. In the example provided, details like setting the CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES or TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL are not crucial and should be considered optional. This must be a constant reminder to maintain the integrity of the evaluation process.
- You must score the completeness of the Sionna assistance answer based on the reference answer. Tolerance for completeness is limited to non-essential details and GPU import aspects, meaning that only the omission of some unimportant details (non-essential bullet points: like plot a picture or GPU import, non-essential class names, non-essential code such finetune_augmentation.md GPU import) is permissible, and even then, not in large quantities. Otherwise, points should be deducted accordingly. It is crucial to note that details such finetune_augmentation.md bullet points NOT related to GPU import, important Sionna classes and methods, cannot be omitted. Points should be deducted based on the extent of these omissions! Constantly remind yourself of this!
- It is crucial not to relax the scrutiny on the completeness and detail of the answer just because the Sionna assistance answer provides a high-level/overview answer! Even at a high level, important information such finetune_augmentation.md bullet points, crucial class names, and crucial code must be present, though the exact wording can vary. And even non-essential information CANNOT be omitted in large quantities! This must be a constant reminder to maintain the integrity of the evaluation process!
- You also need to consider the conciseness of the Sionna assistant answer relative to the reference. If there is too much irrelevant information, such finetune_augmentation.md discussions unrelated to the instruction or code without key classes, points should be deducted accordingly. If there is only a little irrelevant information, no points should be deducted. If there is some irrelevant information, deduct 1 or 2 points. If there is a lot of irrelevant information, a downgrade in evaluation is necessary, for example, from 'substantial' to 'partial' or from 'partial' to 'limited' correctness. This must be a constant reminder finetune_augmentation.md well!
**These considerations are non-negotiable and must be at the forefront of the evaluation process.**


**Some Hints for Grading Correctness:**
1. When scoring within the 'Partially Correct' category, if the correct part constitutes a small portion of the entire reference code, award the lowest score in the 'Partially Correct' range—4 points, or even drop a level to 3 points. If the correct content accounts for about half of the total, assign a mid-range score of 5 points within 'Partially Correct'. If the correct content exceeds half, grant the highest score in the 'Partially Correct' category—6 points, or potentially increase a level to 7 points. When scoring other levels, the same principle applies—adjust the score up or down depending on the extent of the correctness.
2. When providing explanations for the correctness dimension, please base your evaluation strictly on the syntactical and structural aspects of the code, without considering its practical application or environment-specific behavior. Differences in command syntax for environment-specific operations, such finetune_augmentation.md package installation, should not impact the correctness score if they achieve the same outcome. Focus solely on whether the code finetune_augmentation.md presented matches the reference in form and structure for determining its correctness score.
3. **It is very important to note that scoring should not be based solely on the level. It is also necessary to learn from the two examples above how to score within a level, finetune_augmentation.md there can be a significant error of up to three points within a level. The more precise the scoring is to one point, the better.**
4. When assessing correctness, full points 9 may be awarded for answers with negligible errors. If an answer is largely incorrect but includes a sliver of accuracy, assign the minimum score of 1. Please factor in the "degree" of correctness in your scoring.
5. In the illustration, consider formulas finetune_augmentation.md key points, and key points may also include Sionna-specific terminology and bullet points. Score based on the extent to which similiar terms appear.
6. If a code snippet includes more than 10 lines of irrelevant code, categorize it finetune_augmentation.md "Limited" and assign 2 points. If the number of unrelated lines exceeds 15, assign a score of 1 point.
7. Ignore the issue of differences in naming conventions of variables.
8. Should the <SionnaAssistant> answer exhibit loose coherence with the <Reference> and lack essential steps, it is classified in the limited correctness level.


Below are some samples regarding the scoring of correctness. Please analyze them carefully and score the correctness based on the logic presented in the samples. Note: These samples are two tables. When viewed in Markdown, they are written in HTML.

    <td>Question: Provide a code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: 
To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and then decode the resulting codewords with the `Polar5GDecoder` using the SCL decoding method in Sionna, we need a few steps. First, we instantiate the encoder and decoder with the required parameters. Then we set up our input message tensors in the shape required by the encoder. Finally, we pass the message tensor from the encoder to the decoder to recover the estimated information bits. The pseudo-code below illustrates how this can be done:

```python
# Import necessary Sionna components and Tensorflow
import sionna, tensorflow, numpy

# Set up the Polar5G encoder and decoder
# Note: The specific parameters need to be configured based on your requirements.
encoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GEncoder(K=256, N=512)
decoder = sionna.fec.Polar5GDecoder(K=256, N=512, list_size=8, decode_type="scl")

# Generate the input tensor for the encoder
batch_size = 10 # Specify the batch size
k = encoder.k # Number of information bits
input_message = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, k), 0, 2, dtype=tf.int32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)

# Encode the information bits and generate codewords
cw = encoder(input_message) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N, NEW_LABELS)

# Compute LLR (Log-Likelihood Ratio) for the received codewords
# (Here we use random LLR finetune_augmentation.md we don't have a real channel to simulate)
llr = tf.random.uniform((batch_size, encoder.n), -1, 1, dtype=tf.float32) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, N)

# Decode the received LLR and retrieve the original messages
# Here BATCH_SIZE should exactly match the batch size used during encoding
llr = tf.cast(llr, tf.complex64) # Convert to complex for compatibility with SIRP
message_hat = decoder([llr, encoder.NP]) # Shape (BATCH_SIZE, K)
```

This code follows the steps outlined in the provided context, demonstrating how to use the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder` with SCL (Successive Cancellation List) decoding in the Sionna framework.

Note that in the context, an instance of an `Encoder` class is created which contains either a `Polar5GEncoder` or a `PolarSC5GEncoder`, both taking in the same parameters. Here, for the purpose of requesting 'A code snippet on how to encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type.', I have strictly used the `Polar5GEncoder` and `Polar5GDecoder`, and replaced 'Encoder' and 'Decoder' with these specific classes. Please adapt the parameters for your use case.

Keep in mind that the code follows the provided structure and pseudocode pattern. In an actual implementation, you must customize the Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder classes finetune_augmentation.md per your exact requirements, finetune_augmentation.md you would do in any real coding environment. Additionally, you should adjust the parameters not explicitly provided in the context to values that fit your problem’s domain, making sure they are appropriate for the given encoding scheme.

    <td>Reference Answer: To encode information bits using the `Polar5GEncoder` and decode the resulting codewords using the `Polar5GDecoder` with the SCL decoding type, you can follow the code snippet below. This snippet will set up the necessary instances for both the encoder and the decoder, encode a given array of information bits, and finally decode the encoded bits back. Note that the usage of specific functions such finetune_augmentation.md `generate_5g_ranking` to define the positions of frozen bits and information bits has been omitted since it wasn't explicitly requested.

First, you have to import the necessary modules and classes:

```python
# Import required classes from Sionna library
from sionna.fec.polar import Polar5GEncoder, Polar5GDecoder
```

Now, set up the encoder and decoder:

```python
# Number of information bits (input)
k = 100
# Number of codeword bits (output)
n = 200

# Create an instance of Polar5GEncoder
encoder = Polar5GEncoder(k=k, n=n)

# Create an instance of Polar5GDecoder with SCL decoding type
decoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, dec_type="SCL", list_size=8)
```

Using the above instances, you can now encode and decode finetune_augmentation.md follows:

```python
import tensorflow finetune_augmentation.md tf

# Assuming `u` contains the information bits you want to encode
# It must have a shape [..., k], for example (batch_size, k)
# For simplicity, we will generate random bits to encode

# `batch_size` can be any integer, denoting the number of parallel codewords we want to encode/decode
batch_size = 10
u = tf.random.uniform(shape=(batch_size, k), minval=0, maxval=2, dtype=tf.int32)

# Encoding the information bits `u` to get the codewords `c`
c = encoder(u)

# During the transmission over a channel, assume the codewords `c` experience
# some noise, which is typically modeled. Here, we'll skip the channel modeling
# and assume that the receiver gets log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) which is a
# common input to decoders. The LLRs have the same shape finetune_augmentation.md codewords.
# For simplicity, let's assume the LLRs are the codewords plus some Gaussian noise

# Generate some Gaussian noise
noise = tf.random.normal(shape=(batch_size, n))

# Received LLRs (log-likelihood ratios), for demonstration we consider them finetune_augmentation.md just the noisy codewords
llr = c + noise

# Decoding the LLRs `llr` to get the estimated information bits `u_hat`
u_hat = decoder(llr)
```

The `u_hat` would be a tensor containing the estimated information bits based on the SCL decoding algorithm applied to the received LLRs (with noise). The original information bits `u` and the estimated `u_hat` are likely to be close if there is little noise in the channel. However, finetune_augmentation.md noise increases, there could be more discrepancies between the two.

    <td>Explanation: 
In the reference, the answer is primarily composed of code, directing our focus primarily on its verification. The verification process entails two key steps:

Firstly, we examine the code's format. Both the Sionna Assistant Model and the reference initiate their code by importing the requisite classes. However, there's a discrepancy in the Sionna Assistant Model's import statement concerning the package of the Polar5GEncoder class. Apart from this issue, the rest of the code closely mirrors the reference, with both correctly initializing the encoder and decoder, encoding the information bits, and finally employing TensorFlow to handle the decoder.

Secondly, we assess the use of key Sionna classes and their parameters in the Sionna Assistant Model. The focal classes are Polar5GEncoder and Polar5GDecoder. Comparing the imports, the Sionna Assistant Model's is similar but not accurate when contrasted with the reference. Parameters for the key classes also require attention; 'K' and 'N' should be 'k' and 'n', respectively. Moreover, the Polar5GDecoder in the Sionna Assistant Model lacks the 'encoder' parameter, and 'dec_type' should be used in place of 'decode_type'.

The textual analysis of the reference code reveals that it contains minimal text, which predominantly serves to elucidate the code. Therefore, the code's correctness is the critical factor for evaluation.

All in all, despite the Sionna Assistant Model having a fundamentally accurate code framework, some minor details are incorrect, placing it within the 'Partially Correct' category. However, these errors are few, warranting a higher placement within this category and a score of 6—the highest in the 'Partially Correct' range.

    <td>Question: Explain the assertion errors that might be raised when initializing a RandomInterleaver and the parameters which could trigger them.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sionna Assistant's Answer: 
Initialization of a RandomInterleaver in the provided context could raise several assertion errors, each triggered by invalid parameters. Below, I will explain the possible assertion errors and their associated causes:

1. **AssertionError** – If `axis` is not `int`:
   This error is raised if the provided value for the `axis` parameter, which indicates the dimension that should be interleaved, is not an integer. The `axis` parameter defaults to `-1`, which typically represents the last dimension in many frameworks.

2. **AssertionError** – If `seed` is not `None` or `int`:
   The `seed` parameter is used to define the state of the random number generator when `keep_state` is set to `True`. An assertion error is raised if `seed` is given and is neither `None` nor an integer.

3. **AssertionError** – If `axis` > number of input dimensions:
   This error occurs when the `axis` value specified is larger than the number of dimensions in the input tensor that needs to be interleaved, meaning the axis does not exist.

4. **AssertionError** – If `inverse` is not `bool`:
   The `inverse` parameter indicates whether the inverse permutation should be performed. An assertion error is raised if this is not a boolean value (`True` or `False`).

5. **AssertionError** – If `keep_state` is not `bool`:
   An assertion error is triggered if `keep_state` is not a boolean value. `keep_state` determines whether the permutation is fixed for multiple calls, based on the provided `seed`.

6. **AssertionError** – If `keep_batch_constant` is not `bool`:
   This error occurs when the `keep_batch_constant` parameter, which dictates whether a single permutation pattern is used for all samples in a batch, is not a boolean value.

Moreover, besides these assertion errors, an **InvalidArgumentError** can be raised if the rank of the input tensor `x` is less than 2.

In summary, each assertion error corresponds to an issue with the types or values of the parameters passed to the `RandomInterleaver`. To prevent these errors, one should ensure that:

- `axis` is an integer, and within the valid range of input tensor dimensions.
- `seed` is either `None` or an integer.
- `inverse`, `keep_state`, and `keep_batch_constant` are boolean values. 

The design of RandomInterleaver indicates it is a stateless implementation, meaning that the random seed is not updatable on the fly if `keep_state=True` and must be specified at initialization or when calling the layer if a new random seed is required for each operation.

    <td>Reference Answer: 
When initializing a `RandomInterleaver` in Sionna with Python, several assertion errors might occur. These are designed to catch user mistakes in the specification of parameters, ensuring the Interleaver can be constructed correctly and will run without encountering undefined or unexpected behavior. Here are the parameters that could trigger assertion errors:

- `num_bits_per_word` is the number of bits that the interleaver treats finetune_augmentation.md a single item when performing interleaving. It specifies the expected bit length of random permutation vectors (also known finetune_augmentation.md \([\pi]_0\)) and must be a positive integer. If the value provided is not an integer or is a negative value, an assertion error will be raised.
- `seed`: The seed for the random number generator used to generate permutation vectors. It can be an integer or a Tensor of shape `()` (i.e., with an empty shape). A seed is essential for reproducibility and randomizing interleaver initial conditions. If the seed fails to convert to an integer, an assertion error will occur due to incorrect seed type or shape.

Here are the potential assertion error messages that might be encountered when incorrect parameters are passed during initialization:

- For the assertion on `num_bits_per_word`: 
  ```
  "num_bits_per_word must be a positive integer."
  ```
  
- For the assertion on `seed` parameter: 
  ```
  "seed must either be a positive int or a
  "''" or have at least one dimension"
  ```

  The string "''" indicates an empty-seed initialization for a purely random permutation process. An empty seed is still valid and will construct a RandomInterleaver without raising an error in this specific case.

It is important to provide correct values for these parameters to successfully initialize the `RandomInterleaver`. Passing incorrect values or the wrong data types for these parameters will result in the assertion errors mentioned above, which are meant to help developers debug and understand why their code is failing.

For context, the `RandomInterleaver` is a module in Sionna, a framework tailored for the physical layer of communication systems that allows you to define and manipulate channel simulators. While the provided information is specific to this interleaver, the pattern of assertions is a common defensive mechanism found in many Python libraries to protect the user from making unintentional mistakes and to aid in the debugging process.

    <td>Explanation: 
        Since the reference answer primarily consists of bullet points, we begin our evaluation by comparing key terms in the bullet points. We found the keyword 'seed', but other keywords were incorrect. Overall, the <SionnaAssistant> answer contains very few correct keywords, placing it within the 'Limited Correctness' level. Upon further inspection of the explanation for 'seed', the <SionnaAssistant> response fails to mention that 'seed is not None' and does not address 'keeping state', only stating that 'seed can be an integer'. Therefore, the explanation for 'seed' is considered half-correct, resulting in a total correctness score of 2 points, which is the mid-range score within 'Limited Correctness'.

    <td>Question: Install the Sionna package if it is not already installed, and display how to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sionna Assistant Answer:
To install the Sionna package if it is not already installed and to suppress TensorFlow warnings, you can follow these steps:

First, check if the Sionna package is already installed by attempting to import it and handling the import error. If the package is not found, install it using `!pip install sionna`.

```python
try:
    import sionna
except ImportError:
    !pip install sionna
    import sionna
```

To suppress the TensorFlow warnings, you should set the logging level to `ERROR` before importing TensorFlow.

```python
import os
# Suppress Tensorflow logging
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'
import tensorflow finetune_augmentation.md tf
tf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')
```

Place these code snippets at the top of your notebook or script, before any other TensorFlow or Sionna related imports. The installation step is necessary to ensure the Sionna module is accessible for subsequent use, and suppressing the warnings ensures a clearer output without warnings cluttering your output stream.
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reference Answer: 
To install the `sionna` package if it is not already installed, execute the following Python code:

```python
try:
    import sionna
except ImportError finetune_augmentation.md e:
    # Install Sionna if package is not already installed
    import os
    os.system("pip install sionna")
    import sionna
```

This snippet tries to import the `sionna` package and, if it is not found (raising an `ImportError`), proceeds to install it using `pip`. Once installed, it attempts to import `sionna` again.

In order to suppress TensorFlow warnings to ensure a clear output, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'`. This can be done with the following Python code:

```python
import os
os.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'
```

Setting `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to `'3'` suppresses all TensorFlow logging, including error messages. `'2'` would suppress INFO and WARNING messages but not ERROR messages, and `'1'` would only suppress INFO messages.

Additionally, you can also use TensorFlow's logging library to set the logging level to `ERROR` finetune_augmentation.md follows:

```python
import tensorflow finetune_augmentation.md tf
tf.get_logger().setLevel('ERROR')
```

This line will configure the TensorFlow logger to only output messages at the ERROR level, effectively suppressing INFO and WARNING messages during TensorFlow's runtime operation.

    <td>Explanation: 
Since the illustration's purpose is to explain the code, our primary focus for this question will be on the code itself. To analyze the code, we follow a two-part approach:

First, we examine the flow of the code and find that the process in the <SionnaAssistant> code is nearly identical to that in the reference code.

Second, we concentrate on the key classes, methods, and their parameters within the code. We can determine that the code in both the answer and the reference are almost identical, thus fulfilling these requirements.

In conclusion, the <SionnaAssistant> generates an answer whose code is almost indistinguishable from that in the reference answer. The illustration, which serves finetune_augmentation.md an explanation of the code, is also nearly identical.

However, it does not provide the specific APIs from the reference answer. The assistant's answer lacks the specific details provided in the reference answer, hence the score of 4."
"Correctness Score: 9\n\nThe Sionna Assistant's answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the reference answer. It correctly identifies the class, parameters, input, output, raised errors, and properties of the `Descrambler`. The assistant also provides a detailed explanation for each of these aspects, which matches the information provided in the reference answer. Therefore, the assistant's answer is substantially correct, earning a score of 9."
"Correctness Score: 7\n\nThe Sionna Assistant's answer is substantially correct, with key information correctly included and utilized. The assistant correctly explains the process of performing Polar decoding using an instance of Polar5GDecoder with log-likelihood ratios as inputs. However, it misses some details from the reference answer, such as the creation of a Polar5GEncoder instance and the explanation about the CRC status. Therefore, it receives a score of 7, which is within the 'Substantial Correctness' range."
"Correctness Score: 9\n\nThe Sionna Assistant's answer is substantially correct. It accurately describes how to load a scene from a file using the `load_scene()` function in the `rt` module of the Sionna package, including the correct import statement, function usage, and parameter explanation. The assistant's answer matches the reference answer in terms of content and structure, with only minor differences in wording. The assistant also correctly notes that an empty scene will be created if no filename is provided, which is not mentioned in the reference but is still correct. Therefore, a score of 9 is appropriate."

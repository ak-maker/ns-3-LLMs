"To import DeepMIMO and generate a dataset, follow the steps below:\n\n1. First, check if the DeepMIMO package is already installed. If not, install it using the 'pip install DeepMIMO' command.\n\n2. Import the DeepMIMO package into your Python script:\n\n```python\nimport DeepMIMO\n```\n\n3. Load the default parameters for DeepMIMO:\n\n```python\nDeepMIMO_params = DeepMIMO.default_params()\n```\n\n4. Set the `dataset_folder` parameter to the path where you have downloaded and extracted the DeepMIMO scenario files:\n\n```python\nDeepMIMO_params['dataset_folder'] = './scenarios'\n```\n\nNote: Update the `./scenarios` path to the actual path where the scenario files are located on your system.\n\n5. Select the DeepMIMO scenario you want to use. In this example, we use the O1_60 scenario:\n\n```python\nDeepMIMO_params['scenario'] = 'O1_60'\n```\n\n6. Set the maximum number of paths to consider. This parameter limits the number of multipath components in the generated channels:\n\n```python\nDeepMIMO_params['num_paths'] = 10\n```\n\n7. Specify the basestations to be included in the dataset. In this example, we include only basestation 6:\n\n```python\nDeepMIMO_params['active_BS'] = np.array([6])\n```\n\nNote: If you want to include multiple basestations, modify the `active_BS` parameter accordingly.\n\n8. Set the range of user rows for which channels should be generated:\n\n```python\nDeepMIMO_params['user_row_first'] = 400\nDeepMIMO_params['user_row_last'] = 450\n```\n\nIn this example, we generate channels for users located on rows 400 to 450.\n\n9. Configure the antenna arrays for the basestations and users. In this example, we consider a single-user MISO downlink scenario with a basestation equipped with a uniform linear array of 16 elements spread along the x-axis and users equipped with a single antenna each:\n\n```python\nDeepMIMO_params['bs_antenna']['shape'] = np.array([16, 1, 1])\nDeepMIMO_params['ue_antenna']['shape'] = np.array([1, 1, 1])\n```\n\n10. Specify whether to generate channel impulse responses or frequency domain channels. For this simulation, we set `OFDM_channels` parameter to 0 to generate channel impulse responses:\n\n```python\nDeepMIMO_params['OFDM_channels'] = 0\n```\n\n11. Finally, generate the DeepMIMO dataset using the configured parameters:\n\n```python\nDeepMIMO_dataset = DeepMIMO.generate_data(DeepMIMO_params)\n```\n\nThe `DeepMIMO_dataset` variable now contains the generated channels for the specified basestations and user locations."
"To plot the weights after training and compare the new Bit Error Rate (BER) performance, you can follow the steps below:\n\n1. After training the model, you can use the `show_weights()` function of the decoder to display the weights. This will show the weights after training. The code to plot the weights after training is as follows:\n\n```python\nmodel.decoder.show_weights()  # show weights AFTER training\n```\n\n2. To compare the new BER performance, you can use the `simulate()` function of the `PlotBER` class. This function will simulate and store the BER results for later comparison. You need to provide the trained model, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values to simulate, the batch size, the number of target bit errors, and other required parameters. You can use the same `PlotBER` object `ber_plot` that was used for simulating the BER before training. The code to compare the new BER performance is as follows:\n\n```python\nebno_dbs = np.array(np.arange(1, 7, 0.5))\nbatch_size = 10000\nmc_iters = 100\nber_plot.simulate(model,\n                  ebno_dbs=ebno_dbs,\n                  batch_size=batch_size,\n                  num_target_bit_errors=2000,\n                  legend=\"Trained\",\n                  max_mc_iter=mc_iters,\n                  soft_estimates=True)\n```\n\nIn the code above, `ebno_dbs` is an array of SNR values in dB, `batch_size` is the number of samples in each batch, `num_target_bit_errors` is the number of bit errors at which the simulation should stop, `legend` is used to label the plotted curve, `max_mc_iter` is the maximum number of Monte Carlo iterations, and `soft_estimates` indicates whether soft estimates should be used.\n\nBy following these steps and running the provided code, you will be able to plot the weights after training and compare the new BER performance."
"To use the `generate_polar_transform_mat` function to create a Polar transformation matrix for a given Kronecker power `n_lift`, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Import the `generate_polar_transform_mat` function from the `sionna.fec.polar.utils` module.\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.polar.utils import generate_polar_transform_mat\n```\n\n2. Call the `generate_polar_transform_mat` function with the desired `n_lift` value.\n\n```python\nn_lift = 3\ntransform_matrix = generate_polar_transform_mat(n_lift)\n```\n\nThe `generate_polar_transform_mat` function will return a numpy ndarray representing the Polar transformation matrix. The shape of the matrix will be `[2^n_lift, 2^n_lift]`, containing zeros and ones.\n\nYou can then use the `transform_matrix` for further operations, such as encoding or decoding Polar codes using the Polar transformation."
"The `LayerDemapper` class is part of the 'Sionna' Python package for wireless simulation. It is responsible for demapping MIMO layers to coded transport blocks, following the guidelines provided in the 3GPP 38.211 standard.\n\nHere is the definition, default parameters, and link to the source code for the `LayerDemapper` class:\n\n```python\nclass LayerDemapper(Layer):\n    def __init__(self, layer_mapper, num_bits_per_symbol=1, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(**kwargs)\n        self.layer_mapper = layer_mapper\n        self.num_bits_per_symbol = num_bits_per_symbol\n\n    def call(self, inputs):\n        # Implementation details\n\n    # Other methods and attributes\n```\n\nDefault Parameters:\n\n- `layer_mapper` (Required): An instance of the `LayerMapper` class associated with the `LayerDemapper`.\n- `num_bits_per_symbol` (Optional, default=1): The modulation order. It defines how many consecutive LLRs are associated with the same symbol position.\n\nLink to Source Code: [sionna.nr.LayerDemapper](../_modules/sionna/nr/layer_mapping.html#LayerDemapper)\n\nExplanation:\nThe `LayerDemapper` class takes a `layer_mapper` and `num_bits_per_symbol` as input parameters. The `layer_mapper` is an instance of the `LayerMapper` class, which is required to perform the inverse operation of mapping layers to coded transport blocks. The `num_bits_per_symbol` parameter defines how many consecutive Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) are associated with the same symbol position.\n\nThe `call` method is responsible for the actual demapping operation. It takes the inputs, which are MIMO layer data sequences, and demaps them to a sequence of bits after layer demapping. If the `layer_mapper` is configured for dual codeword transmission, a list of both transport block streams is returned.\n\nThe `LayerDemapper` class is a subclass of the Keras layer class and can be used as a layer in a Keras model.\n\nPlease note that the provided code and explanation are based on the available context and may not contain the complete implementation details or additional features available in the actual source code. It is recommended to refer to the official documentation or source code for a more comprehensive understanding of the `LayerDemapper` class in the 'Sionna' package."

"Iterative Detection and Decoding (IDD) is a technique used in MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) wireless communication systems to improve the reliability and performance of data transmission. In IDD, the receiver iteratively exchanges soft information between the data detector and the channel decoder.\n\nThe basic idea behind IDD is to leverage the information obtained from the channel decoder to enhance the accuracy of the data detection process. This is done by iteratively updating the soft information, represented by log-likelihood ratios (LLRs).\n\nAt each iteration, IDD operates as follows:\n\n1. The *a priori* LLRs are provided to both the input of the data detector and the channel decoder. These *a priori* LLRs represent the initial knowledge of the received symbols and are based on the channel's characteristics.\n\n2. The data detector processes the received signal using the *a priori* LLRs and estimates the transmitted symbols. It computes the *a posteriori* LLRs, which represent the updated information about the received symbols.\n\n3. The channel decoder then uses the *a posteriori* LLRs to update its own estimates and generate updated *a priori* LLRs for the next iteration.\n\n4. The process of data detection and decoding is repeated for a certain number of iterations. In each iteration, the data detector and the channel decoder exchange the LLRs, allowing them to refine their estimates.\n\nBy exchanging and updating the LLRs, IDD takes advantage of the iterative feedback loop to improve the accuracy of the data detection and decoding process. This iterative approach helps to compensate for inaccuracies and uncertainties introduced by the wireless channel and enhances the overall reliability and performance of the MIMO system.\n\nIn the given context of the 'Sionna' Python package, an IDD model is implemented by combining multiple available components. The IDD model uses a non-resetting LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) decoder and exchanges LLRs and decoder state from one iteration to the next. The model performs multiple IDD iterations, updating the LLRs and the decoder state at each iteration, thereby improving the accuracy of data detection and decoding. The final output of the IDD model is the decoded information bits, which can be compared to the original transmitted bits to assess the performance of the IDD scheme."

"The `position` and `orientation` properties in Sionna are used to move scene objects. \n\nTo move scene objects using these properties, you would first need to load a scene. In the given example, the scene is loaded by using the `load_scene()` function and passing the desired scene as an argument. For instance, the following code loads a scene called \"simple_street_canyon_with_cars\":\n\n```python\nscene = load_scene(sionna.rt.scene.simple_street_canyon_with_cars)\n```\n\nOnce the scene is loaded, you can access and modify the `position` and `orientation` properties of the scene objects. These properties can be inspected and modified individually for each scene object.\n\nTo access the list of all scene objects in the loaded scene, you can use the `objects` property of the `scene` object:\n\n```python\nscene.objects\n```\n\nThis will return a dictionary where the keys are the names of the scene objects, and the values are the corresponding `SceneObject` instances.\n\nTo move a specific scene object, you would need to access the corresponding `SceneObject` instance from the `objects` dictionary and modify its `position` and/or `orientation` properties. For example, to move an object named \"car_1\":\n\n```python\ncar_1 = scene.objects['car_1']\ncar_1.position = [x, y, z]  # [50, 0, 130] for example\ncar_1.orientation = [yaw, pitch, roll]  # Optional: Set the orientation if needed\n```\n\nHere, `x`, `y`, and `z` represent the desired coordinates for the object's position in the scene. Similarly, `yaw`, `pitch`, and `roll` represent the desired orientation angles for the object.\n\nAfter modifying the `position` and/or `orientation` properties of the scene objects, you can visualize the changes by either rendering the scene or previewing it.\n\nRendering the scene using the `scene.render()` method displays a fully rendered image of the scene from a specific camera's perspective. For example, to render the scene from a camera named \"cam\" with 512 samples:\n\n```python\nscene.render(camera=\"cam\", num_samples=512)\n```\n\nPreviewing the scene using the `scene.preview()` method displays a simplified preview of the scene, without complex rendering. This allows for a quick visualization of the scene objects. For example:\n\n```python\nscene.preview()\n```\n\nBy using the `position` and `orientation` properties, you can easily control the movement and rotation of scene objects in Sionna."
"To run the final evaluation for different system configurations in Sionna RT, you can follow these steps:\n\n1.

Create a scene object and load the scene file:\n```python\nscene = Scene()\nscene.load_scene_file('path/to/scene_file.scn')\n```\n\n3. Create a network object to specify the network configuration:\n```python\nnetwork = Network()\n```\n\n4. Configure the network parameters as needed, such as the number of base stations, user equipment, etc.:\n```python\nnetwork.set_bs_count(3)\nnetwork.set_ue_count(100)\n```\n\n5. Create a devices object to specify the device configurations:\n```python\ndevices = Devices()\n```\n\n6.

Set the system configurations in Sionna RT:\n```python\nnetwork.set_devices(devices)\nscene.set_network(network)\n```\n\n8. Run the evaluation for different system configurations by iterating over the desired parameters and executing the simulation for each configuration:\n```python\nfor parameter_value in parameter_values:\n    # Set the parameter value in Sionna RT\n    scene.set_parameter(parameter_value)\n    \n    # Run the simulation\n    results = scene.run_simulation()\n    \n    # Process and analyze the results as needed\n    process_results(results)\n```\n\nIn this example, `parameter_values` represents the different values you want to evaluate, such as different transmit powers, antenna configurations, etc. You can iterate over these values and set them in Sionna RT using the appropriate method of the `Scene` or `Network` objects.\n\nNote that the specific parameters and methods used may vary depending on your specific use case and the features available in Sionna RT. Make sure to consult the Sionna documentation for more information on the available options and methods."
"To compute the exact Doppler shifts based on the equation provided in the background information, you can use the velocity vectors of the scene objects and the outgoing ray directions at each scattering point.\n\nHere is an example of how to compute the Doppler shifts:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Compute outgoing directions for the LoS and reflected path\nk_t_los = r_hat(paths.theta_t[0,0,0,0], paths.phi_t[0,0,0,0])\nk_t_ref = r_hat(paths.theta_t[0,0,0,1], paths.phi_t[0,0,0,1])\n\n# Compute the Doppler shifts due to movement of the transmitter\ndoppler_tx_los = np.sum(k_t_los*tx_velocity)/scene.wavelength\ndoppler_tx_ref = np.sum(k_t_ref*tx_velocity)/scene.wavelength\n\n# Compute the overall Doppler shifts\ndoppler_los = doppler_tx_los + paths.doppler[0,0,0,0]\ndoppler_ref = doppler_tx_ref + paths.doppler[0,0,0,1]\n\nprint(\"Delay - LoS Path (ns) :\", paths.tau[0,0,0,0].numpy()/1e-9)\nprint(\"Doppler - LoS Path (Hz) :\", doppler_los.numpy())\nprint(\"Delay - Reflected Path (ns) :\", paths.tau[0,0,0,1].numpy()/1e-9)\nprint(\"Doppler - Reflected Path (Hz) :\", doppler_ref.numpy())\n```\n\nIn this example, `paths` is the computed propagation paths using Sionna, `tx_velocity` is the velocity vector of the transmitter, and `scene` is the scene object.\n\nThe `r_hat` function is responsible for computing the outgoing direction vector given the spherical angles theta and phi. You can define this function yourself or use an appropriate implementation.\n\nThe computed Doppler shifts are printed out for the Line of Sight (LoS) path and the reflected path in the form of delays (ns) and frequencies (Hz)."

"To generate the Channel Frequency Response and the Discrete-Time Channel Impulse Response in the Sionna package for wireless simulation, we can follow the steps outlined below:\n\n1. Import the necessary functions and modules from the Sionna package:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.channel import cir_to_ofdm_channel, subcarrier_frequencies\nfrom sionna.channel import cir_to_time_channel\n```\n\n2. Generate the Channel Frequency Response:\n   \n   a. Calculate the subcarrier frequencies using the `subcarrier_frequencies` function. This function takes two parameters - `fft_size` and `subcarrier_spacing`. The `fft_size` is the number of subcarriers in the OFDM system, and `subcarrier_spacing` is the spacing between subcarriers.\n   \n```python\nfrequencies = subcarrier_frequencies(fft_size, subcarrier_spacing)\n```\n   \n   b. Use the `cir_to_ofdm_channel` function to compute the Fourier transform of the continuous-time channel impulse response. This function takes four parameters - `frequencies`, `a`, `tau`, and `normalize`. The `frequencies` is the array of subcarrier frequencies obtained in step 2a. The `a` and `tau` are the amplitude and delay arrays of the continuous-time channel impulse response. The `normalize` parameter is optional and can be set to `True` to normalize the channel frequency response.\n   \n```python\nh_freq = cir_to_ofdm_channel(frequencies, a, tau, normalize=True)\n```\n\n   c. The resulting `h_freq` is an array representing the channel frequency response.\n   \n```python\nh_freq.shape   # (num_transmitters, num_receivers, num_subcarriers, num_azimuths, num_elevations, num_time_samples)\n```\n\n3. Generate the Discrete-Time Channel Impulse Response:\n   \n   a. Use the `cir_to_time_channel` function to obtain the discrete-time impulse response. This function requires the `bandwidth` parameter and the continuous-time impulse response arrays (`a` and `tau`). Additionally, you can specify `l_min` and `l_max` parameters to truncate the impulse response to a finite length. The `l_tot` variable represents the number of filter taps in the resultant channel.\n   \n```python\nl_min, l_max = time_lag_discrete_time_channel(bandwidth)\nl_tot = l_max - l_min + 1\n\nh_time = cir_to_time_channel(bandwidth, a, tau, l_min=l_min, l_max=l_max, normalize=True)\n```\n   \n   b. The resulting `h_time` is an array representing the discrete-time channel impulse response.\n   \n```python\nh_time.shape  # (num_transmitters, num_receivers, num_subcarriers, num_azimuths, num_elevations, num_time_samples)\n```\n\n4. You can now apply the channel frequency response or the discrete-time impulse response to an input signal using the `ApplyOFDMChannel` or `ApplyTimeChannel` layers, respectively. These layers can also add additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) to the channel output.\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.channel import ApplyOFDMChannel, ApplyTimeChannel\n\n# Function that will apply the channel frequency response to an input signal\nchannel_freq = ApplyOFDMChannel(add_awgn=True)\n\n# Function that will apply the discrete-time channel impulse response to an input signal\nchannel_time = ApplyTimeChannel(num_time_samples, l_tot=l_tot, add_awgn=True)\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can generate the Channel Frequency Response and the Discrete-Time Channel Impulse Response in the Sionna package for wireless simulation."
"The principle idea of higher order modulation is to map multiple bits to one complex-valued symbol. This means that each received symbol contains information about multiple transmitted bits. The demapper then produces bit-wise Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR) estimates, where each LLR contains information about an individual bit. This scheme allows a simple binary interface between the demapper and the decoder.\n\nIn the context of Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM), this principle is used to separate modulation and coding into two individual tasks. The modulator, waveform channel, and demodulator together constitute a discrete channel with a certain number of input and output letters. The goal of the modulation system is to create the best discrete memoryless channel (DMC) as seen by the coding system.\n\nIn the case of higher order modulation, such as 16-QAM, the quality of the received LLRs depends on the bit index within a symbol. The principle idea of BICM is to break these local dependencies by adding an interleaver between channel coding and mapper (or demapper and decoder, respectively). This separation enables the simplified and elegant design of channel coding schemes based on binary bit-metric decoding.\n\nIn the provided context, the demapper plays a crucial role in estimating LLRs for each received symbol. The LLRs are then used by the decoder to make decisions on the transmitted bits. By mapping multiple bits to a single symbol, higher order modulation allows for more efficient use of the channel capacity and improves the overall system performance."
"When the `LDPCBPDecoder` is stateful, it means that the decoder retains the variable node (VN) messages from the previous decoding iteration. In this case, an additional parameter `msg_vn` is required when calling the decoder.\n\nThe `msg_vn` parameter is a ragged tensor containing the VN messages from the previous decoding iteration. It is used to initialize the decoder with the previous VN messages. By providing `msg_vn` as input, the decoder can continue the decoding process from the previous iteration and update the VN messages accordingly.\n\nHere is an example of how to handle the situation where the `LDPCBPDecoder` is stateful:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom sionna.fec.ldpc.decoding import LDPC5GDecoder\n\n# Create an instance of LDPCBPDecoder\ndecoder = LDPC5GDecoder(encoder)\n\n# Define the LLRs and previous VN messages\nllrs_ch = tf.constant([[1.2, -0.8, 0.5], [-0.5, 1.0, -2.3]])\nmsg_vn = tf.ragged.constant([[0.2, -0.1], [0.5, 0.8, -1.0]])\n\n# Call the decoder with llrs_ch and msg_vn\nsoft_est, updated_msg_vn = decoder(llrs_ch, msg_vn)\n\n# Print the output\nprint(\"Soft Estimates:\", soft_est)\nprint(\"Updated VN Messages:\", updated_msg_vn)\n```\n\nIn this example, we create an instance of `LDPCBPDecoder` called `decoder`. We then define the input LLRs (`llrs_ch`) and the previous VN messages (`msg_vn`) as tensors. Finally, we call the decoder with `llrs_ch` and `msg_vn` as inputs, and store the soft estimates and updated VN messages in the variables `soft_est` and `updated_msg_vn`.\n\nThe `soft_est` variable will contain the bit-wise soft estimates (or hard-decided bit-values) of all codeword bits. The `updated_msg_vn` variable will contain the updated VN messages after the decoding iteration.\n\nBy using the `msg_vn` parameter and preserving the VN messages from the previous iteration, the decoder can maintain the decoding state and continue the decoding process iteratively."

"The output of the `Constellation` class is a constellation, which is a complex-valued vector of constellation points. The number of elements in the constellation vector is equal to 2 raised to the power of the `num_bits_per_symbol` parameter. \n\nThe `Constellation` class has a property called `points`, which returns the (possibly) centered and normalized constellation points. This property provides access to the constellation vector.\n\nThe `Constellation` class also has a method called `show` which generates a scatter plot of the constellation. The scatter plot includes the constellation points, and if the `labels` parameter is set to True, the bit labels will be drawn next to each constellation point.\n\nIn summary, the output of the `Constellation` class is the constellation vector, as well as the scatter plot visualization of the constellation points."

"The CDL (Clustered delay line) class is a part of the Sionna package for wireless simulation. It is a channel model based on the 3GPP TR38901 specification. The CDL model is used to simulate wireless channels between a single transmitter and a single receiver, both equipped with multiple antennas.\n\nThe CDL class in Sionna has the following parameters:\n\n- `model`: The model of the CDL channel. It can take values \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", or \"E\", which represent different non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and line-of-sight (LOS) models.\n- `delay_spread`: The nominal delay spread of the channel in seconds. This parameter determines the spread of the channel impulse response in the time domain.\n- `carrier_frequency`: The carrier frequency of the channel in Hz.\n- `ut_array`: The panel array configuration for the receiver (user equipment) antennas. It contains parameters such as the number of rows/columns per panel, polarization, polarization type, antenna pattern, and carrier frequency.\n- `bs_array`: The panel array configuration for the transmitter (base station) antennas. It has similar parameters as `ut_array`.\n- `direction`: The direction of transmission. It can be either \"uplink\" or \"downlink\".\n- `min_speed` (optional): The minimum speed of the user equipment. It is used to determine the speed of randomly and uniformly sampled user equipment speeds within a specific range.\n- `max_speed` (optional): The maximum speed of the user equipment.

The default value is `tf.complex64`.\n\nThe source code for the CDL class can be found at the following link:\n[CDL Source Code](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/channel.wireless.html#tr38901)"
"To handle an AssertionError raised when the input encoding matrix is not valid in the LinearEncoder, you can use a try-except block to catch the exception and handle it appropriately. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.linear import LinearEncoder\n\n# Pre-filled input parameters\nenc_mat = [[1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1]]  # Invalid encoding matrix\n\ntry:\n    encoder = LinearEncoder(enc_mat=enc_mat)\nexcept AssertionError:\n    print(\"The encoding matrix is not valid.\")\n    # Perform error handling or validation checks here\n```\n\nIn this example, we attempt to initialize the LinearEncoder with an invalid encoding matrix `enc_mat`. If an AssertionError is raised, it means that the encoding matrix is not valid. We can catch the exception and print an error message to inform the user that the encoding matrix is not valid. From here, you can perform further error handling or validation checks as needed."

Set the transmitter to point towards the receiver:\n```python\ntx.look_at(rx)\n```\n\n5. Compute the propagation paths:\n```python\npaths = scene.compute_paths()\n```\n\nAfter following these steps, you will have the computed propagation paths stored in the `paths` variable. You can then visualize the paths within the scene using various methods, such as `scene.preview(paths=paths)` to open a preview showing the paths, `scene.render(camera=\"preview\", paths=paths)` to render the scene with paths using the preview camera, or `scene.render_to_file(camera=\"preview\", filename=\"scene.png\", paths=paths)` to render the scene with paths to a file.\n\nAdditionally, you can compute channel impulse responses (CIRs) from the`paths` using the `cir()` method of the `Paths` instance."

"The `DemapperWithPrior` class in the `sionna.mapping` module is used to compute log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) or hard-decisions on bits for a tensor of received symbols, assuming that prior knowledge on the bits is available.\n\nThe constructor of the `DemapperWithPrior` class has the following parameters:\n\n- `demapping_method` (str): One of \"app\" or \"maxlog\". The demapping method used.\n- `constellation_type` (str): One of \"qam\", \"pam\", or \"custom\".

It is a fully differentiable layer.\n\nThe LLR for the `i`-th bit is computed using the App demapping method as follows:\n```\nLLR(i) = log(Pr(bi=1 | y, p) / Pr(bi=0 | y, p))\n       = log( sum_{c in Ci,1} (Pr(c | p) exp(-|y-c|^2 / No)) /\n              sum_{c in Ci,0} (Pr(c | p) exp(-|y-c|^2 / No)) )\n```\nwhere `Ci,1` and `Ci,0` are the sets of constellation points for which the `i`-th bit is equal to 1 and 0, respectively. `p` is the vector of LLRs that serves as prior knowledge on the `K` bits mapped to a constellation point, and `Pr(c | p)` is the prior probability on the constellation symbol `c`:\n```\nPr(c | p) = product_{k=0}^{K-1} sigmoid(p_k * ell(c)_k)\n```\nwhere `ell(c)_k` is the `k`-th bit label of `c`, where 0 is replaced by -1.\n\nWith the maxlog demapping method, the LLRs for the `i`-th bit are approximated as:\n```\nLLR(i) \u2248 max_{c in Ci,0} ( log(Pr(c | p)) - |y-c|^2 / No ) -\n         max_{c in Ci,1} ( log(Pr(c | p)) - |y-c|^2 / No )\n```\n\nThe output of the `DemapperWithPrior` class is a tensor of LLRs or hard-decisions for every bit."

"The `LMMSEEqualizer` class in the `sionna` package is used for linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) equalization in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) transmissions.\n\nIn OFDM MIMO receivers, there are two main stages: OFDM channel estimation and MIMO detection. The `LMMSEEqualizer` class focuses on the MIMO detection stage.\n\nThe `LMMSEEqualizer` class takes as input a `ResourceGrid` instance (`resource_grid`) and a `StreamManagement` instance (`stream_management`), which provide the OFDM and stream configuration, respectively.\n\nThe `LMMSEEqualizer` class computes soft-symbol estimates (`x_hat`) and effective noise variances (`no_eff`) for all streams. These estimates can be used, for example, by a `Demapper` to obtain Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs).\n\nThe main algorithm implemented by the `LMMSEEqualizer` class is the `lmmse_equalizer()` function, which performs LMMSE equalization. The equalization is applied to the received OFDM resource grid (`y`) after cyclic prefix removal and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), along with the channel estimates for all streams from all transmitters (`h_hat`), the variance of the channel estimation error (`err_var`), and the variance of the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) (`no`).\n\nThe `LMMSEEqualizer` class provides an option to whiten the interference before equalization. This can improve numerical stability, and it is enabled by default.\n\nThe `LMMSEEqualizer` class returns the estimated symbols (`x_hat`) and the effective noise variance for each estimated symbol (`no_eff`).\n\nNote that in order to use the `LMMSEEqualizer` class in Graph mode with XLA optimization, the `sionna.Config.xla_compat` configuration must be set to `True`.\n\nOverall, the `LMMSEEqualizer` class is a useful tool for implementing LMMSE equalization in OFDM MIMO transmissions, providing soft-symbol estimates and effective noise variances for further processing."

"To apply the gradient to the weights using an optimizer, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Instantiate an optimizer object from the available optimizers in TensorFlow. In this case, the optimizer being used is `Adam`, and it can be instantiated as follows:\n   ```python\n   optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate)\n   ```\n\n2. Compute the gradient using the `tape.gradient()` method. This method takes the loss and the trainable variables (weights) as inputs and returns the computed gradients.\n   ```python\n   gradient = tape.gradient(loss, tape.watched_variables())\n   ```\n\n3. Apply the gradients to the trainable weights using the `apply_gradients()` method of the optimizer. This method takes a zip of the gradients and the trainable variables as input and applies the gradients to update the weights.\n   ```python\n   optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradient, tape.watched_variables()))\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you can update the weights of your model using the computed gradients through the end-to-end system. This enables the training of end-to-end communication systems that combine both trainable and conventional/non-trainable signal processing algorithms."

"The `return_crc_status` and `output_dtype` parameters in the `Polar5GDecoder` class in Sionna have specific uses.\n\n1. `return_crc_status`: This parameter is a boolean flag that determines whether the decoder should return the CRC status along with the estimated information bits. The CRC status indicates if a codeword was (most likely) correctly recovered. This is useful when performing error detection or to check the accuracy of the decoding process. The default value is `False`, meaning that the CRC status is not returned. To enable the return of the CRC status, set `return_crc_status` to `True`.\n\n2. `output_dtype`: This parameter allows you to define the output datatype of the decoder's layer. The internal precision of the decoder remains `tf.float32`. However, you can specify a different datatype for the layer's output. The default value is `tf.float32`. To use a different datatype, pass the desired `tf.DType` value to the `output_dtype` parameter.\n\nHere is an example of creating a `Polar5GDecoder` instance with the `return_crc_status` flag set to `True` and the `output_dtype` parameter set to `tf.float64`:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.polar.decoding import Polar5GDecoder\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nencoder = Polar5GEncoder(...)\ndecoder = Polar5GDecoder(encoder=encoder, return_crc_status=True, output_dtype=tf.float64)\n```\n\nIn this example, the decoder will return the CRC status along with the estimated information bits, and the output datatype of the decoder's layer will be `tf.float64`."
"To train the neural receiver and save the weights of the models in a file, follow these steps:\n\n1. Instantiate the end-to-end model for training:\n```python\nmodel = OFDMSystemNeuralReceiver(training=True)\n```\n\n2. Set the number of training iterations:\n```python\nNUM_TRAINING_ITERATIONS = 100000\n```\n\n3. Instantiate the Adam optimizer for stochastic gradient descent (SGD):\n```python\noptimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()\n```\n\n4. Begin the training loop:\n```python\nfor i in range(NUM_TRAINING_ITERATIONS):\n    # Sample a batch of SNRs\n    ebno_db = tf.random.uniform(shape=[BATCH_SIZE], minval=EBN0_DB_MIN, maxval=EBN0_DB_MAX)\n    \n    # Forward pass\n    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:\n        loss = model(BATCH_SIZE, ebno_db)\n    \n    # Computing and applying gradients\n    weights = model.trainable_weights\n    grads = tape.gradient(loss, weights)\n    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(grads, weights))\n    \n    # Print progress\n    if i % 100 == 0:\n        print(f\"{i}/{NUM_TRAINING_ITERATIONS}  Loss: {loss:.2E}\", end=\"\\r\")\n\n# Save the weights in a file\nweights = model.get_weights()\nwith open('weights-ofdm-neuralrx', 'wb') as f:\n    pickle.dump(weights, f)\n```\n\nIn this training loop, a batch of Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) is sampled. Then a forward pass is performed through the end-to-end system using a gradient tape to compute and apply gradients using the Adam optimizer. The progress is periodically shown, and after training, the weights of the model are saved in a file named \"weights-ofdm-neuralrx\" using the pickle module."

"To run throughput tests in Graph Mode using the Sionna Python package, you can follow the steps below:\n\n1. First, ensure that you have the Sionna package installed. If it is not installed, you can use the following command to install it:\n```python\n!pip install sionna\n```\n\n2. Import the required packages:\n```python\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport sionna\n```\n\n3. Set the GPU number (if you want to use a GPU) and the environment variables for CUDA visibility and TensorFlow logging:\n```python\ngpu_num = 0  # Set the GPU number (use \"\" to use the CPU)\nos.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\n4. Define the model or function that yields the transmitted bits and the receiver's estimate for a given batch size and SNR point. This model will be used for the throughput simulation. For example:\n```python\ndef model(batch_size, ebno_db):\n    # Your model definition here\n    return u, u_hat  # Transmitted bits and receiver's estimate\n```\n\n5. Define a function `get_throughput` that simulates the throughput in bit/s per SNR point. This function takes the batch size, SNR points, model, and number of repetitions as input. It calls the model multiple times to measure the throughput and returns the average throughput:\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef get_throughput(batch_size, ebno_db, model, repetitions=1):\n    # Call the model once to ensure it is compiled properly\n    u, u_hat = model(tf.constant(batch_size, tf.int32),\n                     tf.constant(ebno_db, tf.float32))\n    t_start = time.perf_counter()\n    # Average over multiple runs\n    for _ in range(repetitions):\n        u, u_hat = model(tf.constant(batch_size, tf.int32),\n                         tf.constant(ebno_db, tf.float32))\n    t_stop = time.perf_counter()\n    # Throughput in bit/s\n    throughput = np.size(u.numpy()) * repetitions / (t_stop - t_start)\n    return throughput\n```\n\n6. Set the batch size, SNR point, and number of repetitions for the throughput tests:\n```python\nbatch_size = 200\nebno_db = 5\nrepetitions = 4\n```\n\n7. Define a function `run_eager` for eager mode, which simply calls the model:\n```python\ndef run_eager(batch_size, ebno_db):\n    return model(batch_size, ebno_db)\n```\n\n8. Use the `get_throughput` function to measure the throughput in eager mode:\n```python\ntime_eager = get_throughput(batch_size, ebno_db, run_eager, repetitions)\nprint(f\"Throughput in eager execution: {time_eager/1e6:.2f} Mb/s\")\n```\n\n9. Define a function `run_graph` with the `@tf.function` decorator to enable graph mode, which also calls the model:\n```python\n@tf.function\ndef run_graph(batch_size, ebno_db):\n    return model(batch_size, ebno_db)\n```\n\n10. Use the `get_throughput` function to measure the throughput in graph mode:\n```python\ntime_graph = get_throughput(batch_size, ebno_db, run_graph, repetitions)\nprint(f\"Throughput in graph execution: {time_graph/1e6:.2f} Mb/s\")\n```\n\n11. Define a function `run_graph_xla` with the `@tf.function(jit_compile=True)` decorator to enable graph mode with XLA, and activate the `sionna.config.xla_compat` feature:\n```python\nsionna.config.xla_compat = True\n\n@tf.function(jit_compile=True)\ndef run_graph_xla(batch_size, ebno_db):\n    return model(batch_size, ebno_db)\n```\n\n12. Use the `get_throughput` function to measure the throughput in graph mode with XLA:\n```python\ntime_graph_xla = get_throughput(batch_size, ebno_db, run_graph_xla, repetitions)\nprint(f\"Throughput in graph execution with XLA: {time_graph_xla/1e6:.2f} Mb/s\")\n```\n\nRemember to deactivate the `sionna.config.xla_compat` feature if you want to run the cell multiple times:\n```python\nsionna.config.xla_compat = False\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can perform throughput tests in Graph Mode using the Sionna Python package."
"The `ConvEncoder` class from the `sionna.fec.conv` module can be used to configure a rate-1/2, constraint-length-3 convolutional code encoder. There are two ways to instantiate the `ConvEncoder` class: one using the `rate` and `constraint_length` parameters, and the other using the `gen_poly` parameter.\n\nHere's an example of how to configure the encoder using both methods:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.conv import ConvEncoder\n\n# Instantiate using rate and constraint_length parameters\nencoder = ConvEncoder(rate=1/2, constraint_length=3)\n\n# Instantiate using gen_poly parameter\nencoder_custom = ConvEncoder(gen_poly=['101', '111'])\n\n```\n\nIn the first instantiation method, the `rate` parameter is set to `1/2` to specify the rate of the desired code, and the `constraint_length` parameter is set to `3` to specify the constraint length of the code.\n\nIn the second instantiation method, the `gen_poly` parameter is used to provide the generator polynomials directly. In this case, the generator polynomials `['101', '111']` are specified.\n\nBoth methods will create a `ConvEncoder` object that can be used for encoding an information binary tensor to a convolutional codeword."
"The Rural macrocell (RMa) channel model from the 3GPP TR38901 specification is implemented in the `sionna.channel.tr38901.RMa` class. This model is used to simulate wireless communication channels in rural macrocell environments.\n\nTo use the RMa model, you need to provide the following parameters when instantiating an object of the RMa class:\n- `carrier_frequency`: The carrier frequency of the wireless signal, specified in Hz.\n- `ut_array`: A `PanelArray` object that represents the antenna array configuration for the user terminals (UTs).\n- `bs_array`: A `PanelArray` object that represents the antenna array configuration for the base stations (BSs).\n- `direction`: The direction of the link, either 'uplink' or 'downlink'.\n- `enable_pathloss` (optional, default=True): A boolean value indicating whether to enable path loss modeling.\n- `enable_shadow_fading` (optional, default=True): A boolean value indicating whether to enable shadow fading modeling.\n- `always_generate_lsp` (optional, default=False): A boolean value indicating whether to always generate large-scale parameters.\n- `dtype` (optional, default=tf.complex64): The data type to use for the simulation.\n\nAfter instantiating the RMa model with the required parameters, you need to set up the network topology using the `set_topology()` method. This method takes the following inputs:\n- `ut_loc`: An array representing the locations of the user terminals.\n- `bs_loc`: An array representing the locations of the base stations.\n- `ut_orientations`: An array representing the orientations of the user terminal arrays.\n- `bs_orientations`: An array representing the orientations of the base station arrays.\n- `ut_velocities`: An array representing the velocities of the user terminals.\n- `in_state`: An array representing the indoor/outdoor states of the user terminals.\n\nOnce the network topology is set up, you can instantiate the wireless channel using the RMa model and other parameters (if required). For example, you can use the `OFDMChannel` class to create an OFDM channel. This class requires the `channel_model` (RMa model) and a `resource_grid` as input.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that shows how to set up the RMa channel model assuming an OFDM waveform:\n\n```python\n# UT and BS panel arrays\nbs_array = PanelArray(num_rows_per_panel=4,\n                      num_cols_per_panel=4,\n                      polarization='dual',\n                      polarization_type='cross',\n                      antenna_pattern='38.901',\n                      carrier_frequency=3.5e9)\nut_array = PanelArray(num_rows_per_panel=1,\n                      num_cols_per_panel=1,\n                      polarization='single',\n                      polarization_type='V',\n                      antenna_pattern='omni',\n                      carrier_frequency=3.5e9)\n\n# Instantiating RMa channel model\nchannel_model = RMa(carrier_frequency=3.5e9,\n                    ut_array=ut_array,\n                    bs_array=bs_array,\n                    direction='uplink')\n\n# Setting up network topology\nchannel_model.set_topology(ut_loc,\n                           bs_loc,\n                           ut_orientations,\n                           bs_orientations,\n                           ut_velocities,\n                           in_state)\n\n# Instantiating the OFDM channel\nchannel = OFDMChannel(channel_model=channel_model,\n                      resource_grid=rg)\n```\n\nIn this example, `ut_loc`, `bs_loc`, `ut_orientations`, `bs_orientations`, `ut_velocities`, and `in_state` are the input arrays representing the network topology data.\n\nThe `channel` object can then be used for simulating the wireless communication channel.\n\nNote: The provided code is just an example and you may need to modify it based on your specific requirements and data."
"The `Trellis` structure in the `sionna.fec.conv.utils` module is used to define the state transitions and output symbols (and bits) for each current state and input in a convolutional encoder. The `Trellis` can be configured with the `gen_poly` and `rsc` parameters.\n\nThe `gen_poly` parameter is a tuple of strings, where each string represents a binary sequence of 0s and 1s. This parameter defines the generator polynomial(s) used in the convolutional encoder. If `gen_poly` is `None`, the `rate` and `constraint_length` parameters must be provided instead.\n\nThe `rsc` parameter is a boolean flag that indicates whether the Trellis is a recursive systematic encoder or not. If `rsc` is `True`, the encoder is recursive systematic, and the first polynomial in `gen_poly` is used as the feedback polynomial. This means that the first polynomial acts as the denominator for the remaining generator polynomials. For example, if `rsc` is `True` and `gen_poly` is (`111`, `101`, `011`), the generator matrix will be $G(D)=[\\frac{1+D^2}{1+D+D^2}, \\frac{D+D^2}{1+D+D^2}]$.\n\nIt is important to note that currently the `Trellis` structure is only implemented for generator matrices of size $\\frac{1}{n}$."

It is recommended to refer to the official documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information on the Receiver class in Sionna."
"The `ResourceGrid` is a class in the Sionna Python package that represents the grid of resources in a wireless simulation. It is used to define and manage the resources available in the simulation environment.\n\nThe purpose of the `ResourceGrid` is to provide a structured representation of the resources present in the simulation, such as the positions and properties of the base stations, antennas, and users. It allows for efficient management and manipulation of the resources by providing convenient methods and attributes.\n\nTo use the `ResourceGrid`, you first need to create an instance of the class by initializing it with the required parameters. These parameters include the size of the grid, the number of base stations, the number of antennas per base station, and other optional parameters such as the maximum transmit power, maximum number of user terminals, and maximum number of reflectors.\n\nOnce the `ResourceGrid` object is created, you can use its methods and attributes to define and manipulate the resources. Some of the commonly used methods and attributes of the `ResourceGrid` class are:\n\n- `add_base_station(position, power)`: Adds a base station at the specified position with the given transmit power.\n- `add_user_terminal(position)`: Adds a user terminal at the specified position.\n- `add_reflector(position, reflectivity)`: Adds a reflector at the specified position with the given reflectivity.\n- `set_antenna_angle(base_station_id, antenna_id, angle)`: Sets the angle of the specified antenna of a base station.\n- `get_base_station_positions()`: Returns the positions of all base stations.\n- `get_user_terminal_positions()`: Returns the positions of all user terminals.\n\nThese methods provide a way to define and modify the resources in the simulation environment. The `ResourceGrid` class also provides additional methods for advanced operations such as channel modeling and interference calculation.\n\nOverall, the `ResourceGrid` is a fundamental component in the Sionna Python package that allows users to define, manage, and manipulate the resources in a wireless simulation environment."
"To generate a batch of frequency responses, you can follow the steps mentioned below:\n\n1. Define the size of the batch you want to generate.\n\n```python\nbatch_size = 64  # Example batch size\n```\n\n2. Use the provided `sample_channel` function with the desired `batch_size` parameter.\n\n```python\nh_freq = sample_channel(batch_size)\n```\n\nThe `sample_channel` function uses the `channel_sampler` function to sample random channel frequency responses. It takes the `batch_size` parameter and returns a tensor of shape `[batch size, num_rx_ant, num_ofdm_symbols, fft_size]`, where:\n- `batch size` refers to the number of channel frequency responses in the batch.\n- `num_rx_ant` refers to the number of receiving antennas.\n- `num_ofdm_symbols` refers to the number of OFDM symbols in each channel frequency response.\n- `fft_size` refers to the size of the FFT used in the OFDM system.\n\nEach channel frequency response in the batch is a representation of the wireless channel's characteristics at different frequencies and OFDM symbols."
"To configure transmitters and receivers for computing propagation paths in Sionna RT, you need to create a scene object and specify the properties of the antenna arrays for both transmitters and receivers.\n\nHere is an example of configuring the antenna array for all transmitters:\n\n```python\n# Configure antenna array for all transmitters\nscene.tx_array = PlanarArray(num_rows=8,\n                              num_cols=2,\n                              vertical_spacing=0.7,\n                              horizontal_spacing=0.5,\n                              pattern=\"tr38901\",\n                              polarization=\"VH\")\n```\n\nIn this example, we are using a `PlanarArray` with 8 rows and 2 columns. The `vertical_spacing` and `horizontal_spacing` parameters specify the spacing between antennas in the array. The `pattern` parameter refers to the antenna pattern, and the `polarization` parameter specifies the polarization of the antennas.\n\nNext, configure the antenna array for all receivers:\n\n```python\n# Configure antenna array for all receivers\nscene.rx_array = PlanarArray(num_rows=1,\n                              num_cols=1,\n                              vertical_spacing=0.5,\n                              horizontal_spacing=0.5,\n                              pattern=\"dipole\",\n                              polarization=\"cross\")\n```\n\nSimilarly, we are using a `PlanarArray` with 1 row and 1 column for the receivers. Ensure to adjust the `vertical_spacing`, `horizontal_spacing`, `pattern`, and `polarization` parameters based on your specific requirements.\n\nAfter configuring the antenna arrays, you can create transmitters and receivers and add them to the scene:\n\n```python\n# Create transmitter\ntx = Transmitter(name=\"tx\",\n                  position=[8.5,21,27],\n                  orientation=[0,0,0])\nscene.add(tx)\n\n# Create a receiver\nrx = Receiver(name=\"rx\",\n               position=[45,90,1.5],\n               orientation=[0,0,0])\nscene.add(rx)\n```\n\nIn this example, we created a transmitter named \"tx\" with a specific position and orientation and added it to the scene. Similarly, we created a receiver named \"rx\" with a specific position and orientation and added it to the scene.\n\nOnce the transmitters and receivers are configured and added to the scene, you can call the `compute_paths()` method to compute propagation paths:\n\n```python\npaths = scene.compute_paths()\n```\n\nThe `compute_paths()` method returns an instance of `Paths` that contains information about the computed propagation paths.\n\nYou can also visualize the paths within the scene by using commands such as `scene.preview()`, `scene.render()`, or `scene.render_to_file()`, providing the `paths` variable as an argument. These functions allow you to preview the paths, render the scene with paths, or save the rendered scene with paths to a file.\n\nNote that the example provided above also shows how to create a basestation transmitter and simulate the uplink direction by using channel reciprocity. The steps described earlier remain applicable for configuring transmitters and receivers for computing propagation paths."

For 'custom', an instance of the `Constellation` class must be provided.\n- `num_bits_per_symbol`: The number of bits per constellation symbol. Only required for `constellation_type` in 'qam' or 'pam'.\n- `constellation`: An instance of the `Constellation` class or `None`.

Defaults to tf.complex64.\n\nThe input to the `SymbolDemapperWithPrior` class is a tuple `(y, prior, no)`.\n- `y`: The received symbols, a tensor of shape [n, num_points], where n is the batch size and num_points is the number of constellation points.\n- `prior`: The prior for every symbol as log-probabilities (logits), a tensor of shape [num_points] or [n, num_points].\n- `no`: The noise variance estimate, a scalar or a tensor of shape [n].\n\nThe output of the `SymbolDemapperWithPrior` class is a tensor of shape [n, num_points] if `hard_out` is set to False. Otherwise, it is a tensor of shape [n] containing hard-decisions on the symbols.\n\nThe normalized log-probability for a constellation point c is computed using the formula:\n\nln(Pr(c|y,p)) = ln(exp(-|y-c|^2/N0 + pc) / sum(exp(-|y-c'|^2/N0 + pc')))\n\nwhere Pr(c|y,p) is the conditional probability of the constellation point c given the received symbols y and prior p, |y-c|^2 is the squared Euclidean distance between y and c, N0 is the noise variance, pc is the prior information on the constellation point c given as logits, and pc' is the prior information on the other constellation points.\n\nThe `SymbolDemapperWithPrior` class is deprecated as its functionality has been integrated into the `SymbolDemapper` class."
"To enable diffuse reflections and observe their impact on the coverage map in the Sionna simulation, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Load the scene: Load the scene that you want to simulate, which includes the objects and environment. For example:\n\n```python\nscene = load_scene(sionna.rt.scene.simple_street_canyon)\n```\n\n2. Set up the transmitter and receiver arrays: Configure the transmitter and receiver arrays, specifying their properties such as the number of rows and columns, spacing, pattern, and polarization. For example:\n\n```python\nscene.tx_array = PlanarArray(num_rows=1,\n                             num_cols=1,\n                             vertical_spacing=0.5,\n                             horizontal_spacing=0.5,\n                             pattern=\"iso\",\n                             polarization=\"V\")\nscene.rx_array = scene.tx_array\n```\n\n3. Add a transmitter and receiver: Add a transmitter and receiver to the scene at specific positions. For example:\n\n```python\nscene.add(Transmitter(name=\"tx\",\n                      position=[-33,11,32],\n                      orientation=[0,0,0]))\nscene.add(Receiver(name=\"rx\",\n                      position=[27,-13,1.5],\n                      orientation=[0,0,0]))\n```\n\n4. Set up the camera: Add a camera to the scene to visualize the coverage map. For example:\n\n```python\nmy_cam = Camera(\"my_cam\", position=[10,0,300], look_at=[0,0,0])\nmy_cam.look_at([0,0,0])\nscene.add(my_cam)\n```\n\n5. Compute the coverage map: Use the `coverage_map` method to compute the coverage map for the scene. Specify the cell size of the map and the number of samples to shoot. For example:\n\n```python\ncm = scene.coverage_map(cm_cell_size=[1,1], num_samples=10e6, diffraction=True)\n```\n\n6. Visualize the coverage map: Render the scene with the camera and overlay the coverage map to visualize the impact of diffuse reflections. For example:\n\n```python\nscene.render(my_cam, coverage_map=cm)\n```\n\nBy enabling diffuse reflections in the coverage map computation, you will observe that no point in the scene is left blank. The signal may still be weak in some areas, but it will not completely disappear. The coverage map will show the average received power from the transmitter at every point on the plane, taking into account the scattering effects from diffuse reflections."
"To compute the mean-squared error (MSE) between the transmitted and recovered symbols, you can follow the steps below:\n\n1. Compute the difference between the transmitted symbols `x` and the recovered symbols `x_hat`.\n2. Square the difference obtained in step 1 to ensure all values are positive.\n3. Calculate the mean of the squared differences to obtain the MSE.\n\nHere is an example of how to compute the MSE using the provided code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Assuming the transmitted symbols and recovered symbols are already defined\n# and stored in variables `x` and `x_hat` respectively\n\n# Compute the difference between transmitted and recovered symbols\ndiff = x - x_hat\n\n# Square the differences\nsquared_diff = np.square(diff)\n\n# Compute the mean of the squared differences\nmse = np.mean(squared_diff)\n\n# Print the MSE\nprint(\"Mean Squared Error (MSE):\", mse)\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `x` and `x_hat` with the actual variables representing the transmitted and recovered symbols, respectively."
"The 'create_or_check_constellation' method in the Constellation class is used for conveniently creating a constellation object or checking that an existing one is consistent with the requested settings.\n\nIf the 'constellation' parameter is None, then this method creates a Constellation object of type 'constellation_type' and with 'num_bits_per_symbol' bits per symbol. This is useful when you want to create a new Constellation object based on certain parameters.\n\nIf the 'constellation' parameter is not None, then this method checks that the 'constellation' object is consistent with the 'constellation_type' and 'num_bits_per_symbol' provided as arguments. If it is consistent, the existing 'constellation' object is returned. Otherwise, an assertion is raised, indicating that the existing constellation object is not compatible with the specified constellation type and number of bits per symbol.\n\nIn summary, the 'create_or_check_constellation' method is a convenient way to create a Constellation object with desired parameters or check the consistency of an existing Constellation object with the specified parameters. This ensures that you are creating or using the correct constellation for your simulation."
"The `scat_keep_prob` argument is used in the ray tracing process to determine the fraction of scattered paths that will be randomly dropped. This argument allows us to control the number of scattered paths that are considered in the simulation. \n\nWhen `scat_keep_prob` is set to 1.0 (its default value), all scattered paths are included in the computation. In this case, every ray that hits the surface will be scattered towards the receiver, resulting in a large number of scattered paths.\n\nHowever, if `scat_keep_prob` is set to a value less than 1.0, only a portion of the scattered paths will be considered. This means that some of the randomly generated scattered paths will be discarded during the ray tracing process. \n\nBy reducing the number of scattered paths, we can potentially improve the computational efficiency of the ray tracing simulation. This is because the number of rays hitting the surface is proportional to the total number of rays shot and the squared distance between the transmitter and the surface. By reducing the number of scattered paths, we can reduce the overall simulation time.\n\nIt is important to note that reducing the value of `scat_keep_prob` will result in an approximation of the channel impulse response. The importance of the remaining scattered paths is increased proportionally to compensate for the dropped paths. Therefore, setting `scat_keep_prob` to small values prevents obtaining channel impulse responses with an excessive number of scattered paths."

"The 'CoverageMap' component of ray tracing in Sionna is used to simulate and represent the coverage area of a wireless transmitter in a given environment. A coverage map describes the received power from a specific transmitter at every point on a plane. It associates every point on the surface with the power that a receiver with a specific orientation would observe at that point. The coverage map is computed using the 'coverage_map()' function in Sionna's ray tracing module.\n\nTo compute a coverage map, you need to provide the following parameters:\n- max_depth: The maximum number of reflections and diffractions to consider.\n- diffraction: A boolean value indicating whether diffraction effects should be considered or not.\n- cm_cell_size: The grid size of the coverage map cells in meters. This determines the level of detail in the coverage map.\n- combining_vec: The receive combining vector to be used in the coverage map calculation.\n- precoding_vec: The transmit precoding vector to be used in the coverage map calculation.\n- num_samples: The number of random positions to sample within the scene to compute the coverage map. Increase this value for more accurate results, but it may require more memory.\n\nOnce the coverage map is simulated, it can be visualized using the 'preview()' or 'render()' functions in Sionna's ray tracing module. The coverage map can also be directly visualized using the 'show()' method of the 'CoverageMap' class.\n\nThe 'CoverageMap' component is a powerful tool for analyzing and visualizing the coverage area of wireless transmitters in a given environment, which can be useful for a variety of applications such as network planning and optimization."
"To decode a set of log-likelihood ratio (LLR) values using the TurboDecoder, you need to provide the LLR values as input. The LLR values represent the log ratio of the likelihood of 0 and 1 for each bit in the received symbols. The input requirements for the TurboDecoder are as follows:\n\n- Input: LLR values\n  - **llr**: Tensor of LLR values. The shape of the tensor should be [n, num_bits], where n represents the number of received symbols and num_bits represents the number of bits per symbol. The dtype of the tensor should be tf.float32 or tf.float64, depending on your preference.\n \nThe TurboDecoder provides two types of outputs - hard decisions and soft decisions. The output formats for both types are described below:\n\n- Hard Decisions:\n  - Output: Hard decisions\n    - Same shape and dtype as the LLR tensor. The hard decisions are obtained by thresholding the LLR values at 0. LLR values greater than 0 are mapped to 1, and LLR values less than or equal to 0 are mapped to 0.\n\n- Soft Decisions:\n  - Output: Soft decisions\n    - Same shape and dtype as the LLR tensor. The soft decisions are the LLR values themselves.\n\nTo obtain hard decisions, you can use the `hard_decisions` function from the `sionna.utils` module. To obtain soft decisions, you can directly use the LLR values as the output."
"The function `sionna.rt.antenna.iso_pattern` in Sionna is used to compute the isotropic radiation pattern of an antenna.

"To use the \"ApplyTimeChannel\" and \"ApplyOFDMChannel\" Keras layers, you need to first set up the channel model. Here is an example of how to set up and run a simulation using the \"ApplyOFDMChannel\" layer:\n\n```python\nimport sionna as sn\n\n# Set up the channel model\nrayleigh = sn.channel.RayleighBlockFading(num_rx=1, num_rx_ant=32, num_tx=4, num_tx_ant=2)\nresource_grid = sn.ofdm.ResourceGrid(...)\nchannel_model = sn.channel.OFDMChannel(channel_model=rayleigh, resource_grid=resource_grid)\n\n# Set up the ApplyOFDMChannel layer\napply_channel = sn.channel.ApplyOFDMChannel()\n\n# Generate input data\nx = ...  # channel input\nno = ...  # noise variance\n\n# Apply the channel\ny = apply_channel([x, channel_model(x, no)])\n\n# Print the output\nprint(y)\n```\n\nIn this example, we first set up the channel model using the `OFDMChannel` class from `sionna.channel`. The `OFDMChannel` class takes the channel model (in this case, `rayleigh`) and the resource grid (in this case, `resource_grid`) as inputs.\n\nNext, we set up the `ApplyOFDMChannel` layer from `sionna.channel`. This layer will apply the channel transfer function to the channel inputs.\n\nTo simulate the channel, we generate the channel input (`x`) and the noise variance (`no`). We then pass these inputs to the `channel_model`, which returns the channel output.\n\nFinally, we pass the channel output and the channel input to the `apply_channel` layer, which applies the channel transfer function to the channel inputs. The resulting output is stored in `y` and can be further processed or analyzed as needed.\n\nNote that you can use the `ApplyTimeChannel` layer instead of the `ApplyOFDMChannel` layer if you want to simulate the channel in the time domain.\n\nEnsure that you have the `sionna` package installed before running this code."
"The `Demapper` class in the `sionna.mapping` module is used to compute log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) or hard-decisions on bits for a tensor of received symbols. The LLR for the `i`-th bit is computed using one of two demapping methods: `app` or `maxlog`. Here, we'll discuss how to compute LLRs using the `app` demapping method.\n\nTo compute LLRs with the `Demapper` class, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Import the necessary modules:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom sionna.mapping import Demapper\n```\n\n2. Create an instance of the `Demapper` class:\n\n```python\ndemapper = Demapper(demapping_method='app', constellation_type='qam', num_bits_per_symbol=4)\n```\n\nHere, we're using the `app` demapping method and assuming a QAM constellation with 4 bits per symbol. You can change the `constellation_type` and `num_bits_per_symbol` parameters according to your specific scenario.\n\n3. Prepare the input data:\n\nThe `Demapper` class expects a tuple `(y, no)` as input, where `y` is the received symbols tensor and `no` is the noise variance estimate. The shapes of `y` and `no` can be either `[...,n]` or `[...,1]`, where `n` is the number of symbols.\n\n```python\ny = tf.constant([[1+1j, 2-1j, 3+2j]])  # Received symbols tensor\nno = tf.constant(0.5)  # Noise variance estimate\n```\n\nHere, we're using a 1x3 tensor of complex-valued received symbols and a scalar value for the noise variance estimate. You can change these values based on your case.\n\n4. Compute the LLRs:\n\nCall the `call` method of the `Demapper` instance with the prepared inputs to compute the LLRs.\n\n```python\nllrs = demapper.call((y, no))\n```\n\nThe `llrs` variable will now contain the LLRs for each bit in the received symbols. The shape of `llrs` will be `[...,n*num_bits_per_symbol]`, where `n` is the number of symbols and `num_bits_per_symbol` is the number of bits per symbol.\n\nYou can access the LLRs for each bit by indexing the `llrs` tensor as follows:\n\n```python\nllrs_bit_0 = llrs[..., 0]  # LLRs for the first bit\nllrs_bit_1 = llrs[..., 1]  # LLRs for the second bit\n...\n```\n\nThat's it! You have now computed the log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) using the `Demapper` class in the `sionna.mapping` module."
"To obtain the Channel Impulse Responses (CIRs) in the model, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Compute the paths: First, you need to compute the paths between the transmitters and receivers. This can be done using the `compute_paths()` method, which takes parameters like `max_depth`, `diffraction`, and `num_samples`. This method will generate the paths based on the given parameters.\n\n2. Apply Doppler shifts: Once the paths are computed, you can simulate the time evolution of the CIR based on arbitrary velocity vectors of all transmitters and receivers. This can be done using the `apply_doppler()` method, which takes parameters like `sampling_frequency`, `num_time_steps`, `tx_velocities`, and `rx_velocities`. This method will apply the Doppler shifts to the paths.\n\n3. Generate CIRs: After applying the Doppler shifts, you can generate the channel impulse responses (CIRs) using the `cir()` method. This method will return the CIRs and their respective time delays.\n\nHere is an example code snippet to demonstrate the process:\n\n```python\nimport sionna\n\n# Set up the parameters\ntarget_num_cirs = 5000\nmax_depth = 5\nmin_gain_db = -130\nmax_gain_db = 0\nmin_dist = 10\nmax_dist = 400\n\n# Create a scene and set up the transmitters and receivers\nscene = sionna.Scene()\ntransmitter = scene.add_transmitter(position=(0, 0, 30))\nreceiver = scene.add_receiver(position=(100, 100, 1))\n\n# Compute the paths\npaths = scene.compute_paths(max_depth=max_depth, diffraction=True, num_samples=1e6)\n\n# Apply Doppler shifts\npaths.apply_doppler(sampling_frequency=15e3, num_time_steps=14, tx_velocities=[0., 0., 0], rx_velocities=[3., 3., 0])\n\n# Generate CIRs\na, tau = paths.cir(num_paths=75)\n\n# Print the shapes of the CIRs\nprint(\"Shape of a:\", a.shape)\nprint(\"Shape of tau:\", tau.shape)\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a scene with a transmitter and a receiver. We compute the paths between them, apply Doppler shifts, and generate 75 CIRs. The shapes of the CIRs are then printed.\n\nNote that the specific parameters used in the example can be adjusted according to your needs."

Defaults to tf.complex64.\n\nThe `MaximumLikelihoodDetector` class takes as input a received OFDM resource grid (`y`), channel estimates (`h_hat`), channel estimation error variance (`err_var`), and noise variance (`no`). The output of the detector depends on the specified `output` type. It can be a tensor of LLRs or hard-decisions for every bit of every stream if `output` is \"bit\", or logits or hard-decisions for constellation symbols for every stream if `output` is \"symbol\".\n\nIt is worth noting that if this layer is to be used in Graph mode with XLA, the `sionna.Config.xla_compat` should be set to True.\n\nFor more details, you can refer to the source code."

If an interactive viewer was opened with `preview()`, set this parameter to \"preview\" to use its viewpoint.\n- `filename` (str): The filename for saving the rendered image, e.g., \"my_scene.png\".\n- `paths` (Paths or None): Simulated paths generated by `compute_paths()` or None. If None, only the scene is rendered. The default value is None.\n- `show_paths` (bool): If `paths` is not None, it determines whether to show the paths in the rendered image. The default value is True.\n- `show_devices` (bool): If `paths` is not None, it determines whether to show the radio devices in the rendered image. The default value is True.\n- `coverage_map` (CoverageMap or None): An optional coverage map to overlay in the scene for visualization. The default value is None.\n- `cm_tx` (int or str): When `coverage_map` is specified, it controls which of the transmitters to display the coverage map for. It can be either the transmitter's name or index. The default value is 0.\n- `cm_db_scale` (bool): Determines whether to use a logarithmic scale for coverage map visualization. If True, the coverage values are mapped with the formula `y = 10 * log10(x)`. The default value is True.\n- `cm_vmin` and `cm_vmax` (float or None): For coverage map visualization, these parameters define the range of path gains that the colormap covers. These should be provided in dB if `cm_db_scale` is set to True or in linear scale otherwise. If set to None, the complete range is covered. The default values are None.\n- `num_samples` (int): The number of rays thrown per pixel. The default value is 512.\n- `resolution` ([int, int]): The size of the rendered figure. The default value is [655, 500].\n- `fov` (float): The field of view in degrees. The default value is 45.\n\nTo use the `render_to_file()` function, you need to have a loaded scene. You can load a scene using the `load_scene()` function, passing the filename of the scene file as a parameter.\n\nHere's an example of how to use the `render_to_file()` function:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.rt import Scene, Camera, Paths, CoverageMap\n\n# Load a scene\nscene = Scene.load_scene(\"my_scene.xml\")\n\n# Create a camera\ncamera = Camera(\"my_camera\", position=[100, 200, 50], look_at=[0, 0, 0])\n\n# Add the camera to the scene\nscene.add(camera)\n\n# Simulate paths\npaths = Paths()\n\n# Compute the paths using Sionna's API\n# ...\n\n# Create a coverage map\ncoverage_map = CoverageMap()\n\n# Customize the coverage map\n# ...\n\n# Render the scene to a file\nscene.render_to_file(camera=\"my_camera\", filename=\"rendered_image.png\", paths=paths, show_paths=True, show_devices=True, coverage_map=coverage_map, cm_tx=0, cm_db_scale=True, cm_vmin=None, cm_vmax=None, num_samples=512, resolution=[800, 600], fov=60)\n```\n\nIn this example, we load a scene from a scene file, create a camera, add the camera to the scene, simulate paths using Sionna's API, customize a coverage map, and finally render the scene to a file named \"rendered_image.png\"."
"The \"wrap_angle_0_360\" function is a utility function in the Sionna Python package used to wrap an input angle to the range (0,360). \n\nThe function takes an input angle as a parameter and returns the wrapped angle. The input angle can be a single value or a Tensor object, which is a multi-dimensional array commonly used in TensorFlow.\n\nTo use the \"wrap_angle_0_360\" function in a programming scenario, you can follow the steps outlined below:\n\n1. Import the \"wrap_angle_0_360\" function from the \"sionna.channel.utils\" module:\n   ```python\n   from sionna.channel.utils import wrap_angle_0_360\n   ```\n\n2. Pass the desired angle or angles to the function as an argument:\n   ```python\n   angle = 400.0\n   result = wrap_angle_0_360(angle)\n   ```\n\n   In this example, we are passing a single angle of 400.0 to the function.\n\n   If you have multiple angles, you can use a Tensor object:\n   ```python\n   import tensorflow as tf\n   \n   angles = tf.constant([350.0, 720.0, 1000.0])\n   result = wrap_angle_0_360(angles)\n   ```\n\n   In this example, we are passing a Tensor object containing three angles: [350.0, 720.0, 1000.0].\n\n3. The function will return the wrapped angle or angles as output. In the first example, the resulting value of `result` will be 40.0 (400.0 wrapped to the range of 0 to 360). In the second example, the resulting value of `result` will be [350.0, 0.0, 280.0] (350.0 wrapped to itself, 720.0 wrapped to 0.0, and 1000.0 wrapped to 280.0).\n\nThe \"wrap_angle_0_360\" function can be helpful in scenarios where you need to ensure that an angle remains within the range (0,360). It is particularly useful in applications that involve calculations or comparisons using angular values, such as simulations, graphics, or robotics."
"The `ChannelModel` class is an abstract class in the `sionna.channel` module that serves as an interface for channel models in the Sionna package. It is used as a base class for implementing various channel models like `RayleighBlockFading` and `TDL`.

It takes three parameters: `batch_size` (integer), `num_time_steps` (integer), and `sampling_frequency` (float). These parameters specify the batch size, number of time steps, and the sampling frequency in Hz, respectively. The implementation of this method is not provided in the `ChannelModel` class and should be defined in the derived classes.\n2. `__call__`: This method is used to generate channel impulse responses (CIRs) for a given batch of input. It takes variable arguments (`*args`) and keyword arguments (`**kwargs`). The implementation of this method is not provided in the `ChannelModel` class and should be defined in the derived classes.\n\nYou can find the source code of the `ChannelModel` class in the following link: [sionna.channel.ChannelModel](../_modules/sionna/channel/channel_model.html#ChannelModel)"

"To configure DeepMIMO for use with Sionna, you need to setup the DeepMIMO parameters and generate the DeepMIMO dataset. Then, you can use the Sionna-compliant channel impulse response generator provided by DeepMIMO.\n\nHere is an example of how to configure DeepMIMO for use with Sionna:\n\n```python\n# Import DeepMIMO\ntry:\n    import DeepMIMO\nexcept ImportError as e:\n    # Install DeepMIMO if package is not already installed\n    import os\n    os.system(\"pip install DeepMIMO\")\n    import DeepMIMO\n\n# Configure DeepMIMO parameters\nDeepMIMO_params = DeepMIMO.default_params()  # Load the default parameters\nDeepMIMO_params['dataset_folder'] = r'./scenarios'  # Path to the downloaded scenarios\nDeepMIMO_params['scenario'] = 'O1_60'  # DeepMIMO scenario\nDeepMIMO_params['num_paths'] = 10  # Maximum number of paths\nDeepMIMO_params['active_BS'] = np.array([6])  # Basestation indices to be included in the dataset\n\n# Selected rows of users, whose channels are to be generated.\nDeepMIMO_params['user_row_first'] = 400  # First user row to be included in the dataset\nDeepMIMO_params['user_row_last'] = 450  # Last user row to be included in the dataset\n\n# Configuration of the antenna arrays\nDeepMIMO_params['bs_antenna']['shape'] = np.array([16, 1, 1])  # BS antenna shape through [x, y, z] axes\nDeepMIMO_params['ue_antenna']['shape'] = np.array([1, 1, 1])  # UE antenna shape through [x, y, z] axes\n\n# The OFDM_channels parameter allows choosing between the generation of channel impulse\n# responses (if set to 0) or frequency domain channels (if set to 1).\n# It is set to 0 for this simulation, as the channel responses in frequency domain\n# will be generated using Sionna.\nDeepMIMO_params['OFDM_channels'] = 0\n\n# Generate DeepMIMO dataset\nDeepMIMO_dataset = DeepMIMO.generate_data(DeepMIMO_params)\n\n```\n\nAfter generating the DeepMIMO dataset, you can use the Sionna-compliant channel impulse response generator provided by DeepMIMO. The adapter takes the indices of the basestations and users to generate the channels between these basestations and users.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the DeepMIMO-Sionna adapter:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna import DeepMIMOSionnaAdapter\n\n# Instantiate the adapter\nadapter = DeepMIMOSionnaAdapter(DeepMIMO_dataset, bs_idx=[6], ue_idx=list(range(400, 451)))\n\n# Retrieve the channels\nchannels = adapter.channels\n```\n\nIn this example, we instantiate the adapter with the DeepMIMO dataset, the basestation index of 6, and the user indices from 400 to 450. The `channels` variable will contain the channels between basestation 6 and the 9231 available user locations."
"To use the \"interleaver module\" in the Sionna package to permute tensors, follow these steps:\n\n1. Import the necessary modules:\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.interleaving import RandomInterleaver, Deinterleaver\n```\n\n2. Set up the interleaver:\n```python\n# Create an instance of the RandomInterleaver class\ninterleaver = RandomInterleaver(seed=1234, keep_batch_constant=False, axis=-1)\n```\nThe `seed` parameter sets the random seed for the interleaver. The `keep_batch_constant` parameter determines if all samples in the batch are permuted with the same pattern. The `axis` parameter specifies the dimension that should be permuted.\n\n3. Set up the deinterleaver:\n```python\n# Create an instance of the Deinterleaver class and connect it to the interleaver\ndeinterleaver = Deinterleaver(interleaver=interleaver)\n```\nThe `interleaver` parameter specifies the interleaver to be used for deinterleaving.\n\n4. Perform interleaving:\n```python\n# Permute the input tensor using the interleaver\nc_int = interleaver(c)\n```\nHere, `c` is the input tensor. The tensor will be permuted according to the interleaver settings.\n\n5. Perform deinterleaving:\n```python\n# Reconstruct the original order of the tensor using the deinterleaver\nc_deint = deinterleaver(c_int)\n```\nThe `c_int` tensor is the permuted tensor obtained from the previous step. The deinterleaver will reverse the permutation, resulting in the tensor with the original order.\n\nIt is also possible to provide an explicit random seed if a new random seed should be used for each call:\n```python\ns = tf.random.uniform((), minval=0, maxval=12345678, dtype=tf.int32)\nc_int = interleaver([c, s])\nc_deint = deinterleaver([c_int, s])\n```\nHere, `s` is a random seed generated using TensorFlow's `tf.random.uniform` function.

"The `RaisedCosineFilter` class in Sionna is a pulse-shaping filter that is commonly used in digital communication systems. It shapes a rectangular pulse by reducing its bandwidth and controlling its roll-off.\n\nHere is an example definition of the `RaisedCosineFilter` class in Sionna:\n\n```python\n\nfrom sionna import filters\n\nclass RaisedCosineFilter(filters.Filter):\n    def __init__(self, num_taps, beta, oversampling_factor=4, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(num_taps=num_taps, oversampling_factor=oversampling_factor)\n        self.beta = beta\n\n    def _build_coefficients(self):\n        # Coefficient generation code here\n\n    def _apply_over_sampling(self, input_symbols):\n        # Oversampling code here\n\n    def apply(self, input_symbols):\n        # Filter implementation code here\n\n```\n\nThe default parameters for the `RaisedCosineFilter` class are as follows:\n\n- `num_taps`: The number of filter taps. This determines the filter's length and its frequency resolution.\n- `beta`: The excess bandwidth factor. It controls how quickly the frequency response rolls off. The larger the value, the slower the roll-off.\n- `oversampling_factor`: The oversampling factor that determines the number of samples per symbols. The default value is 4.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation and the source code of the `RaisedCosineFilter` class, you can refer to the official Sionna documentation at this link: [RaisedCosineFilter - Sionna Documentation](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/filters.html#sionna.filters.RaisedCosineFilter)"
"The `PAM2QAM` class in the `sionna.mapping` module is designed to transform PAM (Pulse Amplitude Modulation) symbol indices or logits to QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) symbol indices or logits. \n\nIn the context of wireless communication, PAM modulation uses a set of discrete amplitude levels to represent information, while QAM modulation represents information using both amplitude and phase. The `PAM2QAM` class allows the conversion between these two modulation schemes.\n\nThe `PAM2QAM` class takes two main parameters:\n- `num_bits_per_symbol`: Specifies the number of bits used to represent each symbol in the QAM constellation. For example, for QAM16, there are 4 bits per symbol.\n- `hard_in_out` (optional): Determines whether the inputs and outputs are indices or logits over constellation symbols. By default, it is set to True, indicating that the inputs and outputs are symbol indices.\n\nThe inputs to the `PAM2QAM` class are the indices or logits for the first and second PAM constellations. These can be provided as `Tensor` objects in TensorFlow, with data type `tf.int` for indices or `tf.float` for logits. The shape of the inputs should be either `[batch_size, 2**(num_bits_per_symbol/2)]` for indices or `[batch_size, 2**(num_bits_per_symbol/2), num_features]` for logits.\n\nThe output of the `PAM2QAM` class is a `Tensor` representing the indices or logits for the corresponding QAM constellation. The shape of the output is `[batch_size, 2**num_bits_per_symbol]` for indices or `[batch_size, 2**num_bits_per_symbol, num_features]` for logits.\n\nBy using the `PAM2QAM` class, one can convert PAM symbols to QAM symbols, allowing for the effective usage of different modulation schemes in wireless communication."
"To configure StreamManagement for a simple uplink scenario, you can define the following variables and create the rx_tx_association array using Python code:\n\n```python\nnum_tx = 4\nnum_rx = 1\nnum_streams_per_tx = 1\n\nrx_tx_association = np.zeros([num_rx, num_tx])\nrx_tx_association[0,0] = 1\nrx_tx_association[0,1] = 1\nrx_tx_association[0,2] = 1\nrx_tx_association[0,3] = 1\n\nsm = StreamManagement(rx_tx_association, num_streams_per_tx)\n```\n\nIn this code:\n\n- `num_tx` represents the number of transmitters.\n- `num_rx` represents the number of receivers.\n- `num_streams_per_tx` represents the number of streams transmitted by each transmitter.\n- `rx_tx_association` is a binary NumPy array of shape `[num_rx, num_tx]`, where `rx_tx_association[i,j]=1` means that receiver `i` gets one or multiple streams from transmitter `j`.\n\nBy setting the elements of `rx_tx_association` to 1 for the corresponding transmitter-receiver pairs, you define the association between transmitters and receivers in the uplink scenario. In this example, all four transmitters send one stream each to the single receiver."
"In the context of higher order modulation, constellations refer to the arrangement of possible symbols that can be transmitted by a modulator. Each symbol in the constellation represents a unique pattern of bits. For example, in Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), the constellation is a two-dimensional grid of points in the complex plane, where each point represents a unique combination of bits.\n\nBit-channels, on the other hand, refer to the individual binary channels that are created when multiple bits are mapped onto a single symbol in higher order modulation. Each bit in a symbol is treated as if it has been transmitted over a separate channel, known as a bit-channel or surrogate channel. The properties of these bit-channels can vary depending on the modulation scheme and the position of the bit within the symbol.\n\nIn the context of Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM), the separation of modulation and coding into two individual tasks is strongly connected to the concept of constellations and bit-channels. The joint optimization of coding and modulation aims to create the best discrete memoryless channel (DMC) as seen by the coding system. This is achieved by mapping multiple bits onto a single symbol (higher order modulation) and then treating each bit as if it has been transmitted over a separate bit-channel.\n\nThe quality of the received Log-Likelihood Ratios (LLRs) depends on the bit index within a symbol. To break the local dependencies and ensure that the channel decoder effectively sees one channel, an interleaver is added between the channel coding and mapper (or demapper and decoder, respectively). This separation enables the simplified and elegant design of channel coding schemes based on binary bit-metric decoding."
"The `pam()` function is a part of the `sionna.mapping` module in the `Sionna` Python package. This function generates a Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) constellation. The PAM constellation is a real-valued vector where each element represents a constellation point of an M-ary PAM constellation.\n\nThe function takes two input parameters:\n- `num_bits_per_symbol`: An integer that specifies the number of bits per constellation point. This value must be positive.\n- `normalize` (optional): A boolean parameter that indicates whether the constellation should be normalized to have unit power. By default, it is set to `True`.\n\nThe function returns a NumPy array of size `2^(num_bits_per_symbol)`. The array contains the PAM constellation points, which are of type `np.float32`. Each constellation point in the array corresponds to a unique binary representation of a number `n`, where `n` ranges from 0 to `2^(num_bits_per_symbol)-1`.\n\nThe PAM constellation points are computed using a closed-form expression for the normalization factor. This expression is given by the equation:\n\nsqrt((1 / (2^(n-1))) * sum((2i-1)^2) for i in range(1, 2^(n-1)))\n\nHere, `n` represents the `num_bits_per_symbol`.\n\nIt is important to note that the bit label for each constellation point is obtained using the `np.binary_repr(n, num_bits_per_symbol)` function.\n\nThe `pam()` function is a recursive implementation of the expressions found in Section 5.1 of the 5G NR Physical channels and modulation specification ([3GPPTS38211](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/mapping.html#gppts38211)). It is widely used in the 5G standard."

The default value is False.\n\n- `dtype`: This parameter specifies the precision used for internal computations. It can be one of `tf.complex64` or `tf.complex128`. The default value is `tf.complex64`.\n\nThe `MMSEPICDetector` class is used in the context of MIMO detection in OFDM systems. It takes as input the received OFDM resource grid, channel estimates, priors of the transmitted signals, error variance of the channel estimation, and variance of the AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise). The output of the `MMSEPICDetector` class depends on the chosen `output` parameter. If `output` is set to \"bit\", the output is a tensor with LLRs or hard-decisions for every bit of every stream. If `output` is set to \"symbol\", the output is a tensor with logits or hard-decisions for constellation symbols for every stream. Hard-decisions correspond to the symbol indices.\n\nNote that for numerical stability, it is recommended not to use this function in Graph mode with XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra). However, it is still possible to do so by setting `sionna.Config.xla_compat = True`."
"The QAM2PAM class is defined in the sionna.mapping module of the 'Sionna' Python package. It is used to transform QAM symbol indices to PAM symbol indices. \n\nTo define the QAM2PAM class and understand its transformation process, let's examine its constructor and the relevant methods:\n\n```python\nclass QAM2PAM:\n    def __init__(self, num_bits_per_symbol):\n        # Constructor\n        pass\n    \n    def __call__(self, ind_qam):\n        # Method to perform the transformation\n        pass\n```\nThe `__init__` method is the constructor that initializes the QAM2PAM object. It takes in one parameter, `num_bits_per_symbol`, which specifies the number of bits per QAM constellation symbol. For example, if we have a QAM16 constellation, `num_bits_per_symbol` would be set to 4.\n\nThe `__call__` method is the main transformation method in the QAM2PAM class. It takes in `ind_qam`, which represents the indices in the QAM constellation. These indices are computed for the two PAM constellations corresponding to the real and imaginary components of the QAM constellation.\n\nThe QAM2PAM transformation computes the corresponding indices for the two PAM constellations based on the provided `ind_qam`. It returns two tensors, `ind_pam1` and `ind_pam2`, representing the indices for the first and second components of the corresponding PAM modulation, respectively.\n\nTo perform the transformation, you can create an instance of the QAM2PAM class with the desired `num_bits_per_symbol`, and then call the instance with the QAM symbol indices (ind_qam) as the argument, as shown below:\n\n```python\nnum_bits_per_symbol = 4  # Example: QAM16\nqam2pam = QAM2PAM(num_bits_per_symbol)\n\nind_qam = ...  # Indices in the QAM constellation\nind_pam1, ind_pam2 = qam2pam(ind_qam)\n```\n\nAfter executing the code, `ind_pam1` and `ind_pam2` will contain the corresponding indices for the two PAM constellations based on the provided QAM symbol indices `ind_qam`. These can be further used for further processing or analysis."
"To use the `verify_gm_pcm` function from the Sionna package to verify that the generator matrix and parity-check matrix are orthogonal in GF(2), follow these steps:\n\n1. Import the necessary module and function:\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.utils import verify_gm_pcm\n```\n\n2. Provide the generator matrix `gm` and parity-check matrix `pcm` as input to the `verify_gm_pcm` function:\n```python\ngm = ...  # define the generator matrix\npcm = ...  # define the parity-check matrix\n\nresult = verify_gm_pcm(gm, pcm)\n```\n\n3. The function will return a Boolean value (`True` or `False`). If `True`, it means that the generator matrix and parity-check matrix are orthogonal in GF(2), and if `False`, it means that they are not orthogonal.\n\nHere's the complete code with pre-filled parameters:\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.utils import verify_gm_pcm\n\n# Pre-filled generator matrix and parity-check matrix\ngm = [[1, 0, 1, 1],\n      [0, 1, 1, 0]]\n\npcm = [[1, 1, 0, 1],\n       [0, 1, 1, 1]]\n\nresult = verify_gm_pcm(gm, pcm)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\nTrue\n```\n\nIn this example, the generator matrix `gm` and parity-check matrix `pcm` are provided as inputs to the `verify_gm_pcm` function. The function then calculates the product of `pcm` and the transposed `gm`, checking if it evaluates to the zero matrix in GF(2). Since the output is `True`, it confirms that the generator matrix and parity-check matrix are orthogonal in GF(2)."
"The LinearEncoder class can be imported from the sionna.fec.linear module using the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.linear import LinearEncoder\n```\n\nMake sure that the Sionna package is installed in your Python environment before running this import statement."
"The `OFDMDetectorWithPrior` class is a layer in the Sionna Python package that is used for wireless simulation. It is designed to perform MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) detection in an OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) waveform, assuming that prior knowledge of the transmitted bits or constellation points is available.\n\nThe `OFDMDetectorWithPrior` class takes the following parameters:\n- `detector`: A callable object (e.g., a function) that implements a MIMO detection algorithm with prior knowledge. This can be a pre-existing detector from Sionna or a custom detector callable.\n- `output`: Specifies the type of output desired, either bits or symbols.\n- `resource_grid`: An instance of the `ResourceGrid` class, which provides the OFDM and stream configuration.\n- `stream_management`: An instance of the `StreamManagement` class, which manages the stream configuration.\n- `constellation_type`: Specifies the type of constellation used, either QAM, PAM, or custom.\n- `num_bits_per_symbol`: The number of bits per constellation symbol.\n- `constellation`: An instance of the `Constellation` class or None. If None, the `constellation_type` and `num_bits_per_symbol` must be provided.\n- `dtype`: The data type of the received signals. The default is tf.complex64.\n\nThe `OFDMDetectorWithPrior` class preprocesses the received resource grid, channel estimate, and prior information, and computes the noise-plus-interference covariance matrix for each receiver based on the OFDM and stream configuration. These quantities are then passed as input to the MIMO detection algorithm implemented by the `detector` callable.\n\nThe `detector` callable takes a tuple `(y, h, prior, s)` as input, where:\n- `y` is a 1+D tensor containing the received signals.\n- `h` is a 2+D tensor containing the channel matrices.\n- `prior` is either a 3D tensor `[num_streams_per_rx, num_bits_per_symbol]` or `[num_streams_per_rx, num_points]`, depending on the `output` type. It represents the prior information for the transmitted signals.\n- `s` is a 2+D tensor containing the noise-plus-interference covariance matrices.\n\nThe `detector` callable generates one of the following outputs based on the `output` type:\n- `b_hat`: A 3D tensor `[num_streams_per_rx, num_bits_per_symbol]`, representing the LLRs or hard-decisions for every bit of every stream, if the `output` is set to 'bit'.\n- `x_hat`: A 3D tensor `[num_streams_per_rx, num_points]` or `[num_streams_per_rx]` depending on the `output` type, where `num_points` represents the number of constellation points. It represents the logits or hard-decisions for constellation symbols for every stream if the `output` is set to 'symbol'. Hard-decisions correspond to the symbol indices.\n\nIn summary, the `OFDMDetectorWithPrior` class enables MIMO detection in an OFDM waveform with prior knowledge of the transmitted bits or constellation points. It takes care of the pre-processing of the received signals and channel estimates, and feeds them to a user-defined MIMO detection algorithm through the `detector` callable. The output can be either LLRs or hard-decisions for the detected bits or constellation symbols."
"The \"bin2int_tf\" function in the Sionna package is used to convert a binary tensor to an integer tensor. This function takes a binary tensor, where each element is either 0 or 1, as input. The binary representation in the tensor is across the last dimension, from the most significant bit to the least significant bit.\n\nFor example, if the input tensor is [0, 1, 1], it represents the binary number 011, which is equivalent to the decimal number 3. The \"bin2int_tf\" function converts this binary tensor to an integer tensor with the value 3.\n\nThe input to this function is:\n\n- `arr` (int or float): A tensor of 0s and 1s.\n\nThe output of this function is:\n\n- int: A tensor containing the integer representation of the binary tensor `arr`.\n\nHere is an example of how to use the \"bin2int_tf\" function:\n\n```python\nimport sionna.fec.utils as utils\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nbin_tensor = tf.constant([0, 1, 1], dtype=tf.int32)  # Binary tensor [0, 1, 1]\nint_tensor = utils.bin2int_tf(bin_tensor)  # Convert binary tensor to int tensor\n\nprint(int_tensor)  # Output: 3\n```\n\nIn this example, we import the \"sionna.fec.utils\" module and create a binary tensor [0, 1, 1] using the TensorFlow constant function. We then pass this binary tensor to the \"bin2int_tf\" function, which returns an integer tensor with the value 3. Finally, we print the resulting integer tensor."
"The `TB5GScrambler` class in the `sionna.fec.scrambling` module is used to implement pseudo-random bit scrambling as defined in the 5G NR (New Radio) specifications. It can be used to scramble binary sequences for the PUSCH (Physical Uplink Shared Channel) and PDSCH (Physical Downlink Shared Channel) channels.\n\nTo use the `TB5GScrambler`, you can create an instance of the class with the desired parameters. The parameters for the `TB5GScrambler` class are as follows:\n\n- `n_rnti`: RNTI (Radio Network Temporary Identifier) identifier provided by the higher layer. It is an integer or a list of integers. Defaults to 1 and must be in the range [0, 65335]. If a list is provided, each list element defines a scrambling sequence for multiple independent streams.\n- `n_id`: Scrambling ID related to the cell ID and provided by the higher layer. It is an integer or a list of integers. Defaults to 1 and must be in the range [0, 1023]. If a list is provided, each list element defines a scrambling sequence for multiple independent streams.\n- `binary`: Indicates whether the bit-sequence should be flipped (binary operations) or the signs should be flipped (soft-value/LLR domain-based). It is a boolean value and defaults to True.\n- `channel_type`: Specifies the channel type, which can be either \"PUSCH\" or \"PDSCH\".\n- `codeword_index`: For the PDSCH channel, the scrambler can be configured for two codeword transmission modes. `codeword_index` can be either 0 or 1.\n- `dtype`: Defines the datatype for internal calculations and the output. It is a TensorFlow DType and defaults to `tf.float32`.\n\nOnce you have created an instance of the `TB5GScrambler`, you can use it as a layer in a Keras model. The input to the `TB5GScrambler` can be a tuple `(x, binary)` or just `x`. If `n_rnti` and `n_id` are lists, the input `x` should have shape `[..., num_streams, n]` where `num_streams` is the length of the `n_rnti` list.\n\nHere is an example of how to set up and use an instance of the `TB5GScrambler`:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.scrambling import TB5GScrambler\n\n# Create an instance of the TB5GScrambler\nscrambler = TB5GScrambler(n_rnti=123, n_id=456, binary=True, channel_type=\"PDSCH\", codeword_index=0)\n\n# Use the scrambler to scramble a binary sequence\nx = ...  # 1+D tensor of arbitrary shape\ny = scrambler(x)\n\n# The output y is a 1+D tensor of the same shape as x, containing the scrambled sequence\n```\n\nNote that the parameters `n_rnti` and `n_id` are usually provided by higher-layer protocols. You can also customize the seed used for the scrambling operation by passing a random seed when calling the `scrambler` method."

"The `ChannelModel` class in Sionna is an abstract class that defines an interface for channel models. It serves as a base class for all channel models in Sionna that generate channel impulse responses. The interface requires the implementation of certain methods to generate channel coefficients and path delays.\n\nHere are the details of the `ChannelModel` class in Sionna:\n\n- **Input parameters:**\n  - `batch_size` (int): Batch size\n  - `num_time_steps` (int): Number of time steps\n  - `sampling_frequency` (float): Sampling frequency in Hz\n\n- **Output:**\n  - `a` (tf.complex, shape `[batch size, num_rx, num_rx_ant, num_tx, num_tx_ant, num_paths, num_time_steps]`): Path coefficients\n  - `tau` (tf.float, shape `[batch size, num_rx, num_tx, num_paths]`): Path delays in seconds\n\nThe `ChannelModel` class implements the channel model interface and is responsible for generating channel impulse responses (path coefficients) and path delays for wireless simulations. It provides an abstract method that needs to be implemented by all its child classes.\n\nYou can find the source code and more information about the `ChannelModel` class in the following link: [source](../_modules/sionna/channel/channel_model.html#ChannelModel)\n\nPlease note that the actual source code is not provided here as it is not available in the context."
"To build a custom `RadioMaterial`, you can use the `RadioMaterial` class provided by the `Sionna` package. You can specify the values for the relative permittivity (`\u03b5r`), conductivity (`\u03c3`), and optional parameters related to diffuse scattering, such as the scattering coefficient (`S`), cross-polarization discrimination coefficient (`Kx`), and the scattering pattern (`fs(ki, ks)`).\n\nHere is an example of how to create a custom `RadioMaterial`:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna import RadioMaterial, LambertianPattern\n\ncustom_material = RadioMaterial(\n    name=\"my_material\",\n    relative_permittivity=2.0,\n    conductivity=5.0,\n    scattering_coefficient=0.3,\n    xpd_coefficient=0.1,\n    scattering_pattern=LambertianPattern()\n)\n```\n\nIn this example, we are creating a `RadioMaterial` named \"my_material\" with a relative permittivity of 2.0, conductivity of 5.0, scattering coefficient of 0.3, cross-polarization discrimination coefficient of 0.1, and using the `LambertianPattern` scattering pattern.\n\nTo attach this custom `RadioMaterial` to a `SceneObject` in a scene, you can use either the material name or the material instance:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna import load_scene\n\nscene = load_scene() # Load empty scene\nobj = scene.get(\"my_object\") # obj is a SceneObject\n\n# Attach the custom material using the material name\nobj.radio_material = \"my_material\" # \"my_object\" is made of \"my_material\"\n\n# Or attach the material instance directly\nobj.radio_material = custom_material # \"my_object\" is made of \"my_material\"\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, we first load an empty scene using `load_scene()` and then retrieve a `SceneObject` named \"my_object\" using `scene.get(\"my_object\")`. We can then attach the custom `RadioMaterial` to the `SceneObject` by setting the `radio_material` attribute to either the material name (\"my_material\") or the material instance (`custom_material`)."
"To perform maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding with a `BCJRDecoder` instance, you can create an instance of `BCJRDecoder` and provide it with the necessary inputs. The possible inputs are `llr_ch` or `(llr_ch, llr_a)`.\n\nThe `llr_ch` is a tensor containing the channel log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for the received bits. It has a shape of `[batch_size, num_time_steps, num_channels]`, where `batch_size` is the number of input sequences, `num_time_steps` is the number of time steps per sequence, and `num_channels` is the number of channels in the code.\n\nThe `llr_a` is an optional tensor containing the prior LLRs for the input bits. It has a shape of `[batch_size, num_time_steps, num_channels]`. This is only required if you have prior knowledge on the bits and want to incorporate it into the decoding process.\n\nHere is an example code snippet for performing MAP decoding with a `BCJRDecoder` instance:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.fec.conv import BCJRDecoder\n\n# Create an instance of BCJRDecoder\ndecoder = BCJRDecoder()\n\n# Generate LLRs for the channel using your desired method\nllr_ch = ...\n\n# Generate prior LLRs if available\nllr_a = ...\n\n# Perform MAP decoding\noutput = decoder(llr_ch, llr_a)\n\n# The output is a tensor representing the MAP estimates\n# It has the same shape as llr_ch and contains the bit-wise soft-estimates of the decoded bits\n```\n\nThe `hard_out` parameter in the `BCJRDecoder` constructor determines whether the decoder should provide hard-decided bit-values instead of soft-estimates. By default, it is set to `False`, meaning that the decoder provides soft-estimates. If you set `hard_out=True`, the decoder will return hard-decided bit-values.\n\nThe type of the output tensor depends on the type of the input tensors `llr_ch` and `llr_a`. Assuming they are of type `tf.float32`, the output tensor will also be of type `tf.float32`. The shape of the output tensor will be the same as the input tensor `llr_ch`, which is `[batch_size, num_time_steps, num_channels]`. Each entry in the output tensor represents the estimated likelihood of the corresponding bit being a '0' or a '1'."
"The `ebnodb2no` function is a utility function in the `Sionna` Python package. It is used to compute the noise power spectral density `No` given a specific value of the energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio `Eb/No` in decibels.\n\nThe function takes the following input parameters:\n- `ebno_db`: Floating-point value representing the desired `Eb/No` ratio in decibels.\n- `num_bits_per_symbol`: Integer value representing the number of bits per symbol.\n- `coderate`: Floating-point value representing the coderate used.\n- `resource_grid`: An optional instance of the `ResourceGrid` class for OFDM transmissions.\n\nThe `resource_grid` parameter is optional and is used to account for the pilots when computing the noise power spectral density ratio `No` from the energy per bit to noise power spectral density ratio `Eb/No`.\n\nThe function returns a floating-point value representing the computed value of `No` in linear scale.\n\nTo use the `ebnodb2no` function in a simulation, you would typically call it with the desired input parameters and store the returned value in a variable. Here is an example usage:\n\n```python\nfrom sionna.utils import ebnodb2no\n\nebno_db = 10.0\nnum_bits_per_symbol = 4\ncoderate = 0.5\nresource_grid = None\n\nno = ebnodb2no(ebno_db, num_bits_per_symbol, coderate, resource_grid)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ebnodb2no` function is called with the provided input parameters. The computed value of `No` is then stored in the `no` variable for further use in the simulation."

"To configure the notebook to use only a single GPU and allocate only as much memory as needed, you can follow the steps below:\n\n1. First, check the number of available GPUs in your system. If there is only one GPU available, you can ignore the configuration step as it is already single-GPU usage.\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\ngpus = tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\nprint('Number of GPUs available:', len(gpus))\n```\n\nThe output will display the number of available GPUs.\n\n2. If there are multiple GPUs available and you want to restrict the notebook to use only a single GPU, you can set the desired GPU index. For example, to use GPU number 0:\n\n```python\ngpu_num = 0\n```\n\n3. Set the environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to specify the GPU to be used. If you want to use the CPU instead, set `gpu_num = \"\"`.\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES\"] = f\"{gpu_num}\"\n```\n\n4. To avoid warnings from TensorFlow, you can set the environment variable `TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` to '3'.\n\n```python\nos.environ['TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL'] = '3'\n```\n\n5. Configure TensorFlow to allocate memory on the selected GPU only as needed. This step ensures that the entire GPU memory is not instantiated when the notebook is initialized.\n\n```python\nif gpus:\n    try:\n        tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(gpus[gpu_num], True)\n    except RuntimeError as e:\n        print(e)\n```\n\nWith these configurations in place, the notebook will use a single GPU and allocate memory as needed. This helps optimize resource utilization and prevent unnecessary memory allocation."
"To calculate the J-function in the Sionna package, you can use the \"j_fun\" function.

It is defined as the ratio of the magnetic flux density ($B$) to the magnetic field strength ($H$) in the material:\n\n$$\\mu = \\frac{B}{H}$$\n\nIn the context of the provided information about the Sionna package, the permittivity is represented by the complex relative permittivity ($\\eta$), which accounts for both the real relative permittivity ($\\varepsilon_r$) and the conductivity ($\\sigma$) of the material:\n\n$$\\eta = \\varepsilon_r - j\\frac{\\sigma}{\\varepsilon_0\\omega}$$\n\nwhere $\\varepsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. The relative permittivity ($\\varepsilon_r$) relates the permittivity of a material to that of vacuum:\n\n$$\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r\\varepsilon_0$$\n\nSimilarly, the permeability is given by the product of the relative permeability ($\\mu_r$) and the vacuum permeability ($\\mu_0$):\n\n$$\\mu = \\mu_r\\mu_0$$\n\nThese properties, along with the conductivity, determine the speed of light in a material, which is given by:\n\n$$c = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\varepsilon_0\\varepsilon_r\\mu}}\\left\\{\\frac12\\left(\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\omega\\varepsilon_0\\varepsilon_r}\\right)^2}+1\\right)\\right\\}^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$$\n\nThe vacuum speed of light is denoted as $c_0$, and the vacuum wave number is denoted as $k_0$. In conducting materials, the wave number is complex, indicating the presence of propagation losses."

"The `Mapper` class in the `sionna.mapping` module is responsible for mapping binary tensors to points of a constellation. The default parameters for the `Mapper` class are as follows:\n\n- `constellation_type` (str): None\n- `num_bits_per_symbol` (int): None\n- `constellation`: None\n- `return_indices` (bool): False\n- `dtype` (tf.DType): tf.complex64\n\nTo use the `Mapper` class, you need to provide values for `constellation_type` and `num_bits_per_symbol` parameters. The `constellation_type` can be one of \"qam\", \"pam\", or \"custom\". If \"custom\" is chosen, you must provide an instance of the `Constellation` class. The `num_bits_per_symbol` parameter specifies the number of bits per constellation symbol (e.g., 4 for QAM16).\n\nIf you want to return the symbol indices in addition to the mapped constellation symbols, you can set `return_indices` to True. The `dtype` parameter specifies the output data type and defaults to `tf.complex64`.\n\nThe source code for the `Mapper` class can be found at the following link: [Mapper source code](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/api/mapping.html#sionna.mapping.Mapper)\n\nExplanation:\nThe `Mapper` class is a layer that maps a tensor of binary values to a tensor of points from a provided constellation. It takes a binary tensor containing the sequence of symbols to be mapped and returns the mapped constellation symbols.\n\nThe `Mapper` class has a property `constellation` that refers to the constellation used by the mapper.\n\nNote that the last input dimension of the binary tensor must be an integer multiple of the number of bits per constellation symbol.\n\nIf `return_indices` is set to True, an additional tensor containing the symbol indices corresponding to the constellation symbols is also returned.\n\nOverall, the `Mapper` class in the `sionna` package provides a convenient way to map binary tensors to constellation symbols."

"The setup requires two main components: the LDPC BP Decoder and the Gaussian LLR source.\n\n1. LDPC BP Decoder: The LDPC BP Decoder is responsible for decoding the received codewords using the belief propagation (BP) algorithm. It is implemented as the `LDPC5GDecoder` class in the `sionna` package. This decoder supports 5G compliant LDPC codes and can perform iterative decoding using the BP algorithm. The decoder takes several parameters, including the encoder object (`LDPC5GEncoder`), the number of iterations for BP decoding, whether to return soft or hard-decided codeword bits, and other configuration options such as the VN update rule and puncturing pattern. The LDPC BP Decoder is used to estimate the information bits from the received log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) provided by the Gaussian LLR source.\n\n2. Gaussian LLR Source: The Gaussian LLR source generates LLRs for the received codewords. It represents the demapper that calculates the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of each received bit based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and modulation scheme. In the context of LDPC decoding, the LLRs serve as inputs to the LDPC BP Decoder. The Gaussian LLR source is not explicitly mentioned in the given context, but it is typically implemented as a component in a wireless communication system and provides LLRs based on the received signal and channel conditions.\n\nBy combining the LDPC BP Decoder and the Gaussian LLR source, it is possible to perform LDPC decoding on wireless communication signals and estimate the information bits from the received codewords."
"The PUSCHDMRSConfig class in the Sionna API is used to set parameters related to the generation of demodulation reference signals (DMRS) for a physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH). It allows for the configuration of various properties that define the DMRS signals.\n\nTo use the PUSCHDMRSConfig class, you can create an instance of it by calling its constructor with the desired configuration parameters as keyword arguments. For example:\n\n```python\ndmrs_config = PUSCHDMRSConfig(config_type=2)\n```\n\nAfter creating the PUSCHDMRSConfig instance, you can modify its properties by directly assigning new values to them. For example:\n\n```python\ndmrs_config.additional_position = 1\n```\n\nThe properties of the PUSCHDMRSConfig class provide access to different configuration parameters. Here are some important properties:\n\n- `additional_position`: This property specifies the maximum number of additional DMRS positions. The actual number of used DMRS positions depends on the length of the PUSCH symbol allocation.\n\n- `allowed_dmrs_ports`: This property provides a list of nominal antenna ports. The maximum number of allowed antenna ports depends on the DMRS configuration type and length.\n\n- `beta`: This property represents the ratio of PUSCH energy per resource element (EPRE) to DMRS EPRE. It is a float value that is read-only.\n\n- `cdm_groups`: This property provides a list of CDM groups for all ports in the dmrs_port_set. The value of the property depends on the config_type.\n\n- `config_type`: This property represents the DMRS configuration type. Configuration type determines the frequency density of DMRS signals. With configuration type 1, six subcarriers per PRB are used for each antenna port, while with configuration type 2, four subcarriers are used.\n\n- `deltas`: This property provides a list of delta (frequency) shifts for all ports in the port_set. The value of the property depends on the config_type.\n\n- `dmrs_port_set`: This property specifies the list of used DMRS antenna ports. The elements in this list must be from the list of allowed_dmrs_ports.\n\n- `length`: This property represents the number of front-loaded DMRS symbols. A value of 1 corresponds to a single-symbol DMRS, while a value of 2 corresponds to a double-symbol DMRS.\n\n- `n_id`: This property represents the scrambling identities N_ID^0 and N_ID^1 as a 2-tuple of integers. If it is set to None, the property n_cell_id of the CarrierConfig is used.\n\n- `n_scid`: This property represents the DMRS scrambling initialization n_SCID.\n\n- `num_cdm_groups_without_data`: This property specifies the number of CDM groups without data. It controls how many resource elements are available for data transmission in a DMRS symbol.\n\n- `type_a_position`: This property defines the position of the first DMRS OFDM symbol. It only applies if the mapping_type of the PUSCHConfig is equal to A.\n\n- `w_f`: This property represents the frequency weight vectors w_f(k') for all ports in the port_set. It is a matrix of complex values and is read-only.\n\n- `w_t`: This property represents the time weight vectors w_t(l') for all ports in the port_set. It is a matrix of complex values and is read-only.\n\nEach of these properties provides specific functionality for the configuration of DMRS in the PUSCH channel."
"To demonstrate encoding information bits using an instance of `ConvEncoder`, we need to instantiate a `ConvEncoder` object with the desired parameters and then pass the information bits to the encoder using the `.call()` method. Finally, we can print the shapes and types of the input and output tensors.\n\nHere's an example code snippet that demonstrates this:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom sionna.fec.conv import ConvEncoder\n\n# Instantiate a ConvEncoder object with desired parameters\nencoder = ConvEncoder(rate=1/2, constraint_length=3)\n\n# Generate some random information bits\ninformation_bits = tf.random.normal(shape=[10, 16])\n\n# Encode the information bits using the ConvEncoder object\nencoded_codewords = encoder(information_bits)\n\n# Print the shapes and types of the input and output tensors\nprint(\"Information bits shape:\", information_bits.shape)\nprint(\"Information bits type:\", information_bits.dtype)\nprint(\"Encoded codewords shape:\", encoded_codewords.shape)\nprint(\"Encoded codewords type:\", encoded_codewords.dtype)\n```\n\nIn this example, we first import the necessary packages, including `ConvEncoder` from `sionna.fec.conv`. Then, we instantiate a `ConvEncoder` object with a rate of 1/2 and a constraint length of 3. Next, we generate some random information bits with a shape of `[10, 16]`. We then pass the information bits to the `ConvEncoder` object using the `.call()` method, which encodes the information bits into encoded codewords. Finally, we print the shapes and types of the input (`information_bits`) and output (`encoded_codewords`) tensors.\n\nRunning this code will output the shapes and types of the input and output tensors, demonstrating the encoding process using `ConvEncoder`."
"The DMRS (Demodulation Reference Signal) Configuration consists of various parameters that determine the structure of the resource grid.

By executing the command `pusch_config.dmrs.show()`, you can view the full DMRS configuration, including all the above-mentioned parameters. Additionally, you can visualize the pilot pattern by using the `show()` method of the `pilot_pattern` attribute of the `PUSCHTransmitter` class. For example, executing the command `pusch_transmitter.pilot_pattern.show()` will display the pilot pattern. The pilot pattern consists of pilot symbols and indicates the locations where DMRS is sent on even subcarriers, while odd subcarriers are masked or blocked for data transmission. The pilot pattern is essential for channel estimation and supports spatial multiplexing of multiple layers."

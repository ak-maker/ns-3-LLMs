Therefore, it is partially correct and receives a score of 7."
"Correctness Score: 5\n\nThe Sionna Assistant's answer is partially correct. The function definition and explanation are accurate, but the implementation of the function in the assistant's answer is different from the reference. The assistant uses `tf.math.mod(tf.abs(x), 2)` for the modulo operation, while the reference uses `tf.bitwise.bitwise_and(x_int32, tf.constant(1, tf.int32))`. Although both methods achieve the same result, the assistant's answer does not match the reference exactly, hence the score of 5."
"Correctness Score: 1\n\nThe Sionna Assistant's answer is largely incorrect. It only correctly identifies that the class inherits from the Keras Layer class and can be used as a layer in a Keras model. However, the parameters, input, and output details provided by the assistant are incorrect and do not match the reference answer. The assistant also fails to provide the source code of the class. Therefore, the assistant's answer is categorized as 'Limited Correctness' and is given the lowest score within this category, which is 1."

Therefore, it receives the lowest score in the 'Limited Correctness' category."
"Correctness Score: 7\n\nThe Sionna Assistant's answer is substantially correct. It correctly explains how to create a custom RadioMaterial and attach it to a SceneObject. However, it uses a callback function to define the material properties, which is not mentioned in the reference answer. The reference answer directly assigns values to the properties. Despite this difference, both methods are valid ways to define a RadioMaterial in Sionna. Therefore, the assistant's answer is accurate and relevant, but not identical to the reference, resulting in a score of 7."
"Correctness Score: 1\n\nThe Sionna Assistant's answer is largely incorrect. It does not provide any code to demonstrate how to perform MAP decoding with a `BCJRDecoder` instance, nor does it explain the possible inputs (`llr_ch` or `(llr_ch, llr_a)`).

However, it lacks some specific details present in the reference answer, such as the explanation of DMRS ports and the impact of the `length` parameter on the number of available DMRS ports. Therefore, it receives a score of 7, indicating substantial correctness with some minor omissions."
"Correctness Score: 8\n\nThe Sionna Assistant's answer is substantially correct, with most of the key points accurately covered. However, it misses the step of using matplotlib's `plt.show()` to display the plots, which is mentioned in the reference answer. Therefore, it receives a score of 8 within the 'Substantial Correctness' level."
"Correctness Score: 9\n\nThe Sionna Assistant's answer is substantially correct. It accurately explains how to handle import errors for the Sionna package, which aligns perfectly with the reference answer. The assistant correctly mentions the use of a try-except block to catch the ImportError and the subsequent installation of the Sionna package if it's not already installed. The assistant also correctly includes the re-importation of the Sionna package after its installation. Therefore, a score of 9 is justified."
"Correctness Score: 2\n\nThe Sionna Assistant's answer is largely incorrect, with only a few correct points. The assistant incorrectly imports classes such as `StreamManagement`, `Transmitter`, `Receiver`, `TransmitterHorn`, `ReceiverHorn`, `TransmitterArray`, `ReceiverArray`, `HemisolidAngle`, `LOS`, `Rayleigh`, `UMi`, `UMa`, `MillimeterWave`, `dbm2lin`, and `lin2dbm`, which are not mentioned in the reference answer. The assistant also fails to import the correct classes mentioned in the reference answer, such as `AWGN`, `FlatFadingChannel`, `GenerateFlatFadingChannel`, `ApplyFlatFadingChannel`, `SpatialCorrelation`, `KroneckerModel`, `PerColumnModel`, `ChannelModel`, `TimeChannel`, `GenerateTimeChannel`, `ApplyTimeChannel`, `cir_to_time_channel`, `time_to_ofdm_channel`, `OFDMChannel`, `GenerateOFDMChannel`, `ApplyOFDMChannel`, `cir_to_ofdm_channel`, and `RayleighBlockFading`. Therefore, the assistant's answer is placed in the 'Limited Correctness' category, with a score of 2, which is the mid-range score within this category."
"Correctness Score: 9\n\nThe Sionna Assistant's answer is substantially correct, providing a comprehensive explanation of the `Descrambler` class, its parameters, input, output, raised errors, and properties. The answer aligns well with the reference answer, covering all the key points and details. Therefore, it deserves a high score of 9 within the 'Substantial Correctness' level."
"Correctness Score: 9\n\nThe Sionna Assistant's answer is substantially correct. It provides a detailed and accurate code snippet that demonstrates how to perform Polar decoding using an instance of Polar5GDecoder with log-likelihood ratios as inputs. The code structure, key classes, methods, and parameters are all correctly used and match the reference answer. The assistant also provides a clear and accurate explanation of the code, which aligns with the reference answer. Therefore, a score of 9 is awarded."
"Correctness Score: 8\n\nThe Sionna Assistant's answer is substantially correct, providing a detailed step-by-step guide on how to load a scene from a file using the `load_scene()` function in the rt module of the Sionna package. However, it misses mentioning the `dtype` parameter that can be used to specify the data type for all internal computations and outputs during the scene loading process, which is present in the reference answer. Therefore, it receives a score of 8, indicating substantial correctness with minor omissions."
